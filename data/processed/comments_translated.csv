Danger cannot be allowed to exist.
It’s not just because of throwing the dog, but the usual management of student work is not done well at all. The students themselves have grievances against the school, and they don’t want to vent their anger now.
“The loudest dogs have yet to adopt a dog.”
Three puppies will turn into thirty, three thousand. Can you keep feeding them? boss? Don&#39;t bankrupt yourself for the sake of hype
A group of ownerless dogs, of course, no one has a leash, and they don’t know how to inject vaccines. The shop owner actually summoned him to the street where people come and go, and he also pretended to be a virgin // @杀台狗: It’s an illegal thing, actually I still feel very proud
There are people in our community who feed cats. When the time comes, many cats will gather together. Why don’t you take these “holy ladies” home and raise them?
Dogs are cute, why should ducks blame them? In three years, 12 generations of hundreds of cute little yellow ducks grew up, were slaughtered, and became their dinner. What is there to flaunt about this hypocrisy?
Good dogs don&#39;t bite, only evil dogs do. Those who have been proven to be vicious dogs should be resolutely killed
With so much kitchen waste, we should be responsible for how much we can save on disposal fees.
@张信宇@陈凯浩@李娜@李小然@阿多@杨迪@李素 @薛志强@兰西 The opportunity has come. These strays are so cute. Come and adopt them as soon as possible. Don’t be blind, deaf, mute, or paralyzed?
What&#39;s wrong with me, Joe Chen? Why don&#39;t you get me a group of stray dogs too?
Okay, if these three dogs bite passers-by, someone will be able to compensate them~~~

If someone yells twice online, why do you still take it seriously?
There are caring people who feed stray cats in the community at their own expense, and then, fearing the proliferation of wild cats, they spend their own money to sterilize them. I don’t know if it’s true love or to satisfy their so-called kindness.
My focus was a little biased. It turns out that the electric license plates in Henan are yellow, and there are many numbers. The whole plate is so big.

Need to hunt
Web link calling for dog ban!
There have been cases where the person who fed the food was held responsible.
They are all gentlemen who only like to talk.
Only feeding without neutering will only lead to more and more stray dogs!
It&#39;s strange that these newsmen have a conscience. Doesn&#39;t this fix the evidence? As long as something goes wrong, the person feeding him won&#39;t be able to escape even if he wants to.
Last time, I saw a girl’s father who killed a stray dog that was in the community. Dog lovers insulted the father in front of the children, and even stood guard at the door with a threatening tone, regardless of whether the girl would accept it or not. Come on, will there be any psychological shadow? If you love me so much, why didn’t you take that dog away in the first place?
Everyone has good and bad qualities, not to mention dogs. If a dog bites, he will be beaten to death, but if you cull the dogs that are not a problem at will, then there will be a problem, right?
When stray dogs bite people, why can’t the neighborhood committee and street office be held responsible? They have an obligation to deal with it.
Alaska should not be a stray dog. After being exposed for biting people, if there is no certificate, the dog owner will not recognize it and it will become a fake stray dog.
&quot;You may not love them, but please don&#39;t hurt them.&quot; This is a saying often said by dog lovers. So on the other hand, dogs, if you don’t love me, can you please stop hurting me? Dogs, if you don’t love that little girl and boy, why do you want to hurt them? Because people have human nature and have laws and morals to restrain their behavior, but dogs only have instincts and cannot restrain themselves. If the dog is not restrained, then the dog is not qualified to be at the same height as the person.
Dog owners are helpless if they cannot afford to pay compensation, so they should ban their dogs in crowded places or take other effective measures.
This little boy was bitten seriously by a dog!
Forward Weibo
The so-called dog is a friend, but the reality is that dogs are used as playthings, tools and slaves!
Therefore, many people will despise celebrities, because some celebrities are inherently people who do not know right from wrong and have incorrect views!
Don’t do too many of these things. Children are mainly hurt, because in the eyes of these canines, they are easier to bully.
They are so caring and love dogs. If a stray dog bites someone, then they, as the owner, should be held responsible. They should pay for it or go to jail.

Yes, good point
Who will pay for the bitten person?
I don’t know what to say, but with so many good examples to follow, practicing law is the fundamental and decisive solution, right?
When a society allows raising dogs, the society must first raise people well.
&quot;If the dog that caused the accident was led by a leash when going out and was supervised by its owner, it would not be able to hurt the child in any way.&quot; Is it true that &quot;it can&#39;t be hurt in any way&quot;? Civilization cannot rely on self-consciousness, but on severe punishment.
There are too many uncontrolled dogs, which have become so common that they affect everyone’s travel safety. They are all caused by irresponsible dog owners. It is part of the nature of wild dogs to bite people, and passers-by should not be allowed to do anything to those who abandon them. The owner of the dog pays the bill.
The annual fee for dog registration and implementation of responsibility is 2-10,000, and an annual health review is conducted every year. Wouldn&#39;t that be great?
If there are no dogs in the city, there will be no harm. It is uncivilized to keep dogs, and it is not civilized to keep dogs.
Stray and off-leash dog bites are a human problem... but in the end, dogs bear most of the blame!
Dog fans: woof woof woof
How many people would take the initiative to attack a dog if it didn&#39;t provoke or scare them?
One word hits the mark
It should be set up to be downloaded locally and widely disseminated

If you want to follow this, the blogger himself or repost it?
Transparent!
My ability is limited and I only adopted one. But I still have a little bit more ability to scold dog lovers.
Is the aunt in the video you?
At that time, if they remained silent and did not treat victims of cyberbullying or dog beaters, they would have a conscience.
#全民 appeals for dog slaves and dogs to be equally guilty, and resolutely hunt down stray cats and dogs# It is incredible that the country cannot control dog slaves and dogs.
Bite or bite to death
If it is a real stray dog, it should also be compassionate and reasonable. Dogs are inherently rational, but they became stray dogs due to bad reincarnation. Stray dogs also have life.
Which stray dog is not abandoned by a dog lover?
Beautiful woman said it well
Adoption instead of trading refers to the adoption of existing stray dogs that cannot be properly accommodated. It is not the adoption of new &quot;commercial dogs&quot; bred through pet trading. The adoption package implements the &quot;ban on pet dog trading&quot;. Together, these two policies are called The purpose of &quot;adoption instead of buying and selling&quot; is to digest the stock and restrain the increase. The basic concepts are unclear. Are you really confused, or are you confusing things and leading others to follow the &quot;adoption instead of sale&quot; policy in a confused way?
There is no way for misfortunes and blessings, but people call it upon themselves. Increasing merit and deeds will eliminate disasters: Weak body, gentle nature, be gentle in behavior, courteous in movement and stillness, humble in speech, do not argue about right and wrong, live in poverty without complaining, do not judge others, blame yourself for disasters and illnesses, give without expecting retribution, be calm, etc., have a calm mind and a calm mind. , do not remember old evils, respect the elderly, cultivate filial piety internally, be tranquil and relaxed, respect heaven and earth, be kind and humble, love life and evil, be compassionate and considerate, and other hundred medicines, there will be no cruelty outside, no illness and pain inside, happiness, longevity and health .
We are responsible for ourselves, others cannot be responsible for us. Humans are the spirit of all things. When we look at everything gently, our nature will naturally be revealed, and other animals will respect us and be friendly to us. If we are arrogant, greedy, strong and brave, our nature is covered up, making animals afraid when they see us. When we get close, we are afraid of being hurt and attack people. If you are injured by an animal, you can deal with the animal in question, but do not anger other animals.
If you don’t restrain yourself not to create problems, and if you don’t take the initiative to solve the problems you create, you have to ask society to tolerate problems. This is their true face.
More comprehensive.
That German Shepherd was actually handled quite reasonably, but it couldn&#39;t stand up to the rumors.
I wish the little girl a speedy recovery, support seeking compensation from the dog owner, and support holding those who raped and spread rumors against the girl’s family accountable.
That makes sense
Yes
you&#39;re right
This is a good way to handle the problem

Good evening
I dreamed of a flower seller saying to me with nothing in his hands: Only when people feel happy can they see roses.
People will criticize you as soon as you ask for donations, so don’t ask for donations unless you absolutely have to.
Hurry up and file a claim with the dog owner.
I&#39;m afraid that the dog owner will not pay compensation, saying that he has no money. It&#39;s not like there are no such cases.
Netizens like fresh and exciting ideas. They will jump on whichever point of view is fresher and more bizarre. So just take a look and do what they do, and the more you do, the more mistakes you make.
I am still thinking today, if there is an opportunity to raise more money, ordinary people may not be able to resist the temptation. No matter what, they will bear the disaster. Whether it is forced or conscience finds it, returning it is a kind of psychological relief. Children, grow up well. big
Return to donor? How to withdraw?
I did donate a lot
Good night, sweet dreams
I hope the child will recover soon
# man spent 1,000 yuan to rent a crane to rescue a trapped stray cat# Therefore, not everyone can raise a dog.
What you said on Weibo before was not so rational. You just said that celebrities speaking out for stray dogs were incomprehensible. You looked like humans are superior! If you had said this earlier, no one would have attacked you.
I have observed a lot of scolding accounts, and they are basically trolls. Don&#39;t worry, normal people wouldn&#39;t do that.
Don’t take it too seriously. Most of the extreme comments are made by trolls and robots.
To put it bluntly, many IDs are fed by others with the purpose of causing war.
It&#39;s useless for you to reason with them. They eat people&#39;s food and talk nonsense. Dogs are their zu zong.
Many people are too extreme
You are very patient. Most mothers are very patient. However, when it comes to these so-called dog lovers, your explanation is just an explanation to your true fans. For those people, most of them won&#39;t listen. Don&#39;t pay attention to them. Just report them and block them.
I also saw a person caring about what to do with the biting dog. It was so weird.
Very well said, very right
Support tiger moms, that’s great.
I can&#39;t talk to you calmly. I&#39;m just trying to provoke a fight.
Support bloggers, there are still more normal people in China
A few words from others: &quot;You are...&quot;, &quot;In the final analysis...&quot;, &quot;I am...&quot;. No matter how much you explain, it&#39;s useless. People don&#39;t want to hear your explanation, so they can just vent themselves. For example, when I gave a speech once, a patient left a message, &quot;You just criticize, slander and insult others...&quot; &quot;You are just sour...&quot; Haha, patients all have the same words.
Very well said, I agree.

You understand silver!
Yes, in fact, more than 90% of those who bite people are domestic dogs, but people dare not say it because they are afraid of being attacked by the dog owner, so they vent their anger on stray dogs. The stray dogs I see in the city are all very afraid of people, and will try their best to please people. Only domestic dogs are vicious and vicious (my dog is very vicious, so I never let it get close to people).

A group of people are accusing human beings of being cruel, but they are not biting you. Of course you can be a beautiful Virgin~
Damn, the first one is the most useful. If you want to keep a dog, you should announce it in the community first. More than half of the residents agree and go through the procedures to keep one.
Why do you always have to pay for raising a dog in Germany? This tax and that fee. In a word, German taxpayers&#39; money is used to raise people, not dogs. It’s okay to keep a dog and pay taxes. Therefore, German dogs are also called &quot;tax dogs&quot;
Some people say that the dog-raising regulations in Germany are too strict, and it is not allowed for dogs to bark in their own homes. What can I say? Think about it, you are having sex and your neighbor’s dog barks. That would be scary. What does it mean to be people-oriented? Germany is that.
Foreigners kill and eat dogs to repay Japanese dogs, #UKcrocodileexpert sexually assaulted 42 dogs and caused 39 deaths. No so-called &quot;animal protection&quot; bloggers have come out to condemn this topic, biting a 2-year-old little girl from his own country It&#39;s quite fierce.
These are some of the articles in the Animal Protection Law that people are thinking about.
I remember watching a foreign documentary where a dog barked at home and the neighbors complained directly. In the end, they had to cut their vocal cords.
The problem is that there is no relevant law in the country. No one suggested it...it&#39;s useless to just say it online...
There really is a dog ethics academy
People are sentenced for abusing animals, and arbitrary breeding is not allowed. Stray animals are adopted uniformly. Stray animals are adopted uniformly. All those without happiness are adopted away.
Domestic dog lovers just want to enjoy their rights and don’t want to take on responsibilities. The responsibility is thrown to society.
Didn’t patriots use cars as an example? If a car kills someone, does that mean it is banned? Then let them take four exams and pass the exam before they can raise a dog.
Can I say that someone is incompetent or causing trouble if the right track is not picked up?
Celebrities who speak out for dogs should donate 5 million each to animal adoption centers in each city. Nowadays, the adoption centers rely on the government to provide part of the money and citizens donate part of it. The cost is far from enough, so the conditions are very poor. Recently, all the animal adoption centers have been closed down. At the adoption station, those who violate the regulations when applying for dog certificates can collect the fines after paying the fine. I appeal to those who care for animals and speak out online to stop talking and make donations to prove their true love.
Support sending all these stray dogs to the homes of the following actors @阿多 @陈凯浩 @杨迪 @ 张信宇 @谢智强
Where did 40 million stray dogs come from? It wasn&#39;t thrown away by a dog owner.
Tu&#39;ao is not as strict, but its treatment of stray cats and dogs is similar to that in Germany. So I have been in Tu&#39;ao for more than 10 years and have never seen a stray cat or dog. Some people have really last resort reasons (such as illness) and cannot continue to keep them, and they will send them to shelters themselves.
The management of stray dogs in China has become an international topic, far beyond the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Palestine and Israel.
&quot;The moon in foreign countries is so round&quot;
Great, I think this is how to treat dogs as family members
Internet users have raised the severity of this wave of dog beating incidents to the same level as Japan’s discharge of nuclear sewage into the sea, and have expressed that they no longer love humans.
To raise a dog abroad, the area of the house and yard is also required. You don’t have to be qualified just to raise a dog.
Which star comes to take it away and keep it?
There is a fool who said that foreign dogs can enter shopping malls, schools, planes and subways.
Reposted from a German netizen: Germany also has many laws to protect dogs, such as: 1. Abuse of dogs: fined or imprisoned for up to three years 2. Killing of dogs: fined or imprisoned for up to three years 3. Failure to take adequate care of the owner: fined or imprisoned Imprisonment of up to three years 4. Attempted or negligent cruelty of a dog: fine up to 25,000 euros 5. Abandonment of a dog: fine up to 25,000 euros 6. Stealing a dog, selling it as stolen goods or embezzlement: fine or imprisonment
In the past, crayfish were also a problem for the ecology, right? Now I go to ordinary ponds to catch a few small ones, but they are all solved by diners. It is recommended to promote the characteristics of Huajiang, the first of Guizhou&#39;s three wonders, to solve stray dogs.
This can indeed be learned from
Just copy it, and add another one. Dogs in the city not only need to be on a leash when going out, but also have to be muzzled.
How many celebrities have been raised in the pet industry chain?
Weibo is fine, but some news is the hardest hit area. They are doing all kinds of tricks, so I will take care of them as long as I can, but I won’t take good care of them.
Support, their animal protection laws are also very sound and we should learn from them
Two additional things: dogs over 6 months old must wear a muzzle, and the length of the dog leash should not exceed two meters outdoors and one meter indoors.
Where are there so many stray dogs? For us, stray dogs are just meat. Dog meat is in short supply at the beginning of winter and winter. Dog thieves everywhere.
good idea!
I strongly support learning from the advanced dog laws in the West. People who really love dogs will not be reluctant to spend this money. If such a law is implemented in our country, the fees will definitely not be so expensive, and as long as it is strictly necessary, there will definitely be exemptions. Raising the threshold is good for both dogs and people.
I agree with the Animal Protection Law. Please follow this standard.
11 Very good, is it suitable for stray cats?
If you want to enjoy your rights, you must fulfill basic obligations
When it comes to spending money, animal rights activists are all silent. Their faith can be measured by money. As long as the funds are in place, no matter what faith they believe in, they can make money and do business, which is not shabby.
This is good 👍
@杨迪@陈浩然 is this good or not? Is it reasonable?
People who were bitten by dogs when they were young will always walk around when they see a dog, especially one that can startle you when it suddenly jumps up to you. This is so necessary.
Another day of loving Germany
This can be supported, starting with cities
Germany’s dog-raising regulations are very good, and they are kind to other people and dogs, so there should be no stray dogs.
Worse than warning
This is indeed possible
No wonder people in the West always save dogs first when rescuing victims. It turns out they can’t afford to throw them away.
These regulations can be copied completely
I wonder why there are no stray dogs here. Could it be because we are in the same province as a city that holds a dog meat festival?
I have to say that the Germans are still rigorous. The moon is really round.
Is Germany playing so hard?
I&#39;ve been to Germany and didn&#39;t notice this. real or fake? But you really need to learn this.
At least most people do not meet the conditions for raising a dog in Germany.
Pet lovers are asked to cull instead of abandoning pets when they abandon them, so as to solve the problem of stray animals from the source.
It is indeed necessary to legislate immediately: the &quot;Pet Feeding Management Law&quot;, those who abandon, disturb residents, harm others, etc. will be sentenced to more than three years in prison
We can learn from the American way of handling
It’s a good method. If there is no buying and selling, there will be no harm.
Not only are there no stray dogs, but there are not many domesticated dogs.
@海文娜 Please tell me, is this true? Thanks
After all, it is still a human problem. Once the dog is in charge, the dog&#39;s problem will naturally be solved.

I still say the same thing, the root cause of dog problems lies with people. Another sentence, whether you like it or not, this world is a human world.
It is a must.
should learn
I particularly like dogs and cats, but I also really don’t understand some pet owners who don’t pick up dog poop on the ground while walking. Many people keep pets just to show off. They don’t want to keep stray dogs and throw them away at will. They have no sense of responsibility at all. What can be done? Apart from sending them to shelters for adoption, they can only be disposed of harmlessly. Otherwise, if they are allowed to breed and the streets are filled with stray dogs, hypocritical people like these will complain more than anyone else if they bite a big shot.
People who are afraid of dogs have only one purpose, and that is to ensure that people will not be chased and bitten by dogs. But I don’t know why some people are so vicious. They won’t even let people who are afraid of dogs raise this reasonable request. If they mention it, they will be criticized by those people who are afraid of dogs. It is really unjust.
People who have been chased by dogs are afraid of dogs. People who have been chased by dogs are afraid of dogs. People who have been chased by dogs are afraid of dogs. People who have been chased by dogs are afraid of dogs.
I met a large dog once before when I went out. The kind that stood taller than a person, bared its teeth, and had foam all around the dog&#39;s mouth. The owner of the dog was walking on the road, playing with his mobile phone in one hand. Holding the rope with one hand, Ma De barked at me and rushed towards me. The man couldn&#39;t hold it back. There was a shovel in the garbage truck next to me. I picked it up directly. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t come over. I didn&#39;t even know it was possible without the rope. And those who walk large dogs on leashes, can they really hold them back in case of an accident?
You are really too salty to eat carrots and worry about you, oil cakes
Then the culling of stray dogs is also an accident. Is there anything you can&#39;t accept? It&#39;s an accident that you are still alive.
Do you think that if one person kills another, should everyone be destroyed?
If calculated this way, killing stray dogs should be regarded as eliminating accidents, which is equivalent to filling the holes in the ground.
It’s all about standing and talking without pain in the back. Forget the list. Sooner or later, you’ll catch up.
Then killing stray dogs is the same as filling up pits.
Tie up your child from now on, I&#39;m afraid it will bite me
“Dog lovers” often say, “There is nothing wrong with dogs,” and there is nothing wrong with that statement. But &quot;dog lovers&quot; forget that &quot;many people who are affected by stray dogs are not wrong.&quot; If all dog lovers could talk less and adopt stray dogs more, instead of morally kidnapping people who don’t love dogs or own dogs and those who are truly affected, then dog lovers would be a very respectable group.
The accident of a dog lover is incomprehensible
Please look at this matter correctly. When dog lovers call for the protection of stray dogs, they are never asking for the protection of stray dogs that hurt people. Even if dog lovers see stray dogs that hurt people, wouldn’t they be afraid just like ordinary people?
Blogger, the stray dogs you are talking about are the types of dogs that have owners but are abandoned or let loose. According to the comments on the picture, he may have thought that the dog was left to fend for itself and was called a stray dog. Moreover, dogs are originally an animal that fends for itself in this world. It is because people keep it in order to distinguish it, so no one raises it and calls it a stray dog.
Please calm down, everyone. Currently, some so-called &quot;dog lovers&quot; are actually paid to deliberately provoke opposition. Most real dog lovers do not. Don&#39;t be fooled, discuss the issue in a civilized manner and make reasonable suggestions. Thank you.
It turns out it was recommended by the marketing account’s homepage. I thought I was paying attention.
Then someone drowns and wants to fill up all the seas?
People who object to dogs are actually people who love dog meat. They don’t know that a lot of dog meat is poisoned by dog thieves. For example, cyanide will decompose at high temperatures. As for whether the dog meat vendors cook the dog meat thoroughly, who knows.
Killing is not scary, and killing a dog is not illegal. What are you afraid of? It doesn’t matter whether someone barks or a dog barks.
Dog lovers always only pay lip service to their benevolence and morality. When asked to take action, every one of them will pretend to be dead.
For so-called dog lovers, stray dogs are treated equally, and they will not bite them just because of who they are. Taking care of your pet is key to avoiding accidental injuries.
It’s amazing to compare a kitchen knife with a stray dog. One is a still life and the other is an animal. One is passive and the other is active. He bites people and spreads diseases. I don’t know how his brain circuits are so clear.
Pile him up to 1 million fans and release the dog.
The so-called dog lovers are basically ugly dogs. See if they can speak out. These dog lovers are really disgusting.
How filial!
Dogs are the parents of dog lovers
Are there any potholes in the road? Just leave the hole alone, why not fill it all in? Can&#39;t all the pits be wiped out?
Stray dogs should be humanely destroyed if no one can adopt them.
The trap won&#39;t come up on its own and make you sprain your feet.
&quot;Wei, you are not allowed to fill the hole in your foot. If you do, I will scold you!&quot;

Picture comments
Please don’t attribute the fault of the dog that harmed people to a group of dogs. How is this different from the ancient &quot;involving nine tribes&quot;. Respect for life means not only responsibility and love for the life around you, but also responsibility and love for all life in society.
When dog lovers call for the protection of stray dogs, they ask humans not to attack stray dogs indiscriminately. They are inherently part of society. In our country, there are often declarations of people living in harmony with nature, and there are often people who transform nature without destroying it. slogan, this is not an empty talk.
If an unowned dog bites someone, it will be treated as an accident. Otherwise, would you just grab someone to compensate the dog? Just like if a domestic pig is gored by you, you need to find the owner. If a wild boar is gored by you, you have to arrest someone to take responsibility. Isn&#39;t it appropriate? Secondly, I am a dog lover. There are many people in this world who love dogs, are afraid of dogs, hurt dogs, and are hurt by dogs. Just like in human society, aren’t there people who hurt each other or even kill each other?
It&#39;s obviously a domestic dog biting someone, so why do they all attack stray dogs?
Some people are just not as good as dogs, like you
As long as you know how to take it easy and study more
Inciting war to earn traffic? Not afraid of that
Otherwise, will you be held responsible? Dog-hating beauty
Yes, but will they shut up when individuals kill stray dogs?
So in order to avoid accidents, we should catch them all and kill them all, no problem.
Isn’t this just 🐶 speaking for 🐶?
It&#39;s really not an accident that there is a pit when I go out. Find the property management company within the community and the road maintenance department outside the community.
He is nothing more than a double standard person. How can he handle an accident so calmly?
According to dog lovers, even if he was hit by a car and died, the driver would not be required to pay compensation and it would be treated as an accident.
There is a hole in the ground. Don&#39;t you want the road administration department to ask for it to be filled? Why did the giant baby become unusually tolerant when it was his turn to be bitten by a dog?
It was an accident that he got beaten when he went out.
I heard that there are people around me who take money to raise stray dogs. They can do so many things even with ordinary family conditions. Celebrities are calling on you, but you haven’t done as much as an ordinary person. You say it’s a hammer.
Hello, the &quot;Voice for Stray Dogs&quot; that you are interested in has opened the Chaohua Community ~ Chaohua Community is an interest-based interactive community under Weibo. Come and interact with like-minded friends! Click me to enter &gt;&gt; Speak up for stray dogs
There is one attitude before biting, and another attitude after biting.
You have many words and are not extreme. I give you a thumbs up.
I really can&#39;t stand it anymore. I watch a certain short video platform every day, and I watch this on Aite. I don&#39;t even pay attention to this matter. The real world asks me, and in the online world, when I watch videos to relax, I want to watch these on Aite. thing. If you think it&#39;s unfair, just provide your own funds and find a way to set up a base to adopt them. You don&#39;t want everyone to be accommodating, like it, and understand it.
To be honest, these people are just idle and full of food.
Parks dedicated to cats and dogs could recruit advertisers for pet products, which would subsidize lawn maintenance and camera costs. Holding a two-day weekend pet supplies exhibition every month to sample cat and dog food can also boost the economy. There are even DINK families and elderly people living alone who buy houses near exclusive parks in order to make their pets live a better life. This will also have a positive effect on the economy. Then dog and cat owners will be less likely to walk in the community to reduce the worries of others.
Don&#39;t just speak out, donate money
This matter has become polarizing, alas😮💨
You can’t control others, but you can control yourself, protect your own furry children, and wear a leash and muzzle🙏
Dog owners have no sense of responsibility and end up being so weird that they cannot speak and cannot accurately understand human beings. This is how extremists are in dogs. They cannot see the core of the matter and cannot deal with people. They can only deal with dogs that cannot speak. The Internet is really a virtual slaughterhouse
If people don&#39;t hurt dogs, how can dogs hurt people? The weak little animals just want to protect themselves. In the end, if the person is bitten, it is still the dog&#39;s fault.
But didn’t the dog that bit the girl have an owner? In fact, I don’t understand how it ended up being a confrontation between a man and a stray dog.
Everything is a human problem, but now it is really crazy to transfer all the problems to dogs.
Adopting instead of buying is great.
It’s normal, don’t talk about dogs. Look at some people in Israel now. Isn’t it surprising that some people are eager to exterminate the Jews?
It&#39;s really sad that there are more and better management methods, but now a vicious dog bites people, leading to a bunch of extreme people biting dogs.
Love and responsibility
Dogs are man’s best friends. I hope dog owners will love their dogs well and not abandon them.
The only time I was bitten by a dog in my life was at the instigation of the security guard in our factory (the dog was very good, it only bit the leg symbolically without breaking the skin), but the security guard often let the dog out to scare the girls in the factory. , so scared that they screamed again and again! Therefore, it is the people who are bad, not the dogs!
Yang Di, Liu Yase said: Don’t hunt and kill Li Na, Zhang Xinyu said: Humans and dogs are not opposites, Xue Zhiqian changed the lyrics for his concert; Lan Xi, speaking out for stray dogs: Can we discuss the matter? Can you have your own opinion? A Duo: The killed puppy turned into a small mound, Liu Cong, Li Xiaoran and Li Na: I have saved your kind, can I let mine go? Wang Zhaoyang: He just wants a family. #王 Zhaoyang speaks for stray dogs#
Stray dogs still need to be managed. For example, can the celebrity who appeals crowdfund a charity fund? Whether you live with a cat or you are a rabbit dad, the rescue experience of these caring organizations proves that rescue work requires money, and it cannot be generated with love. What&#39;s more, if the number of stray dogs increases in an area, a dog pack will form. In the animal world, hunting is possible, which is not a good thing for the elderly and the weak. We still have hundreds of millions of people who currently have very low incomes.
Clicked, the most honest statement I have seen recently
It is very selfish for humans to keep pets. Animals should live in nature and gather in groups with their own kind, rather than becoming human playthings to satisfy human selfish interests.
The recent trend of massacre on the Internet has been driven by rhythm. In fact, it is basically based on capturing.
He caught a stray dog and followed it to his own mother. Do you remember what holiday it is today?
In fact, there are groups behind the operation.
Mouth substitute, I said what I wanted to say but I don’t know how to say it
👍👍👍
Clicked, my mouth took over
Reply to @MRCloudTianlai: The truth is out. There must be forces behind it. Firstly, it allows people to release their grievances, and secondly, it allows the public to fight among themselves and divert attention.
The gap between rich and poor is too large and society is unstable. Eliminating the wealthy at the top has always been a major social issue. Just be content. You have to be born a few decades earlier to catch up with the 1960s and 1970s, and you can be beaten until your brains bloom.
Yes, there are so many cases of school bullying that go unnoticed. Even if they are exposed, the news disappears within a few days.
This is ideology
The earth is not just for humans! The dogs are not strays, they are free!
Respect life, revere life
Stray dogs are also human beings and should be handled properly and should not be driven away violently
Respect Life
Everything has spirit
All things are animistic and revere life
The earth is not only a place for humans to live, but also a home for dogs and humans. Dogs need to listen to dog songs, but humans cannot live without dogs
All life should be treated reasonably
All life should be respected!
Protect the dogs! ! ! ! !
The world cannot go around without puppies
Vicious dogs that hurt people should be dealt with properly instead of killing innocent stray dogs indiscriminately.
All life should be respected!
Dogs are also lives. We hope that each of us can do our best to care for them. As dog owners, we should also take this responsibility and strictly manage our dogs to prevent them from hurting others.
All living things deserve respect and should be treated reasonably.
We cannot deny all stray dogs because of one vicious dog, we must respect all life
Harmonious coexistence between humans and animals
You don’t have to love me, but please don’t hurt me.
Sincerely opposed to the advancement of boxers: Boycott the Boxer Alliance
I was raped, who is responsible? Treat as unexpected. Take responsibility for yourself. Is it difficult to buy accident insurance for tens of dollars a year?
If the speaker is bitten, what will he say?
Since it is an accident, it is normal for me to eliminate the hidden dangers of accidents in advance.
What would she do if he bit her?
How can you repay a secretly changed concept? Will pits take the initiative to bite you? If you step on pitfalls, you will be blind. If you are bitten by a dog, you will be bitten because you don&#39;t have eyes. Do you deserve to be bitten?
After all, girls help gou
This is not the point of dispute now. There is no civil subject to hold accountable these stray dogs. Once bitten, there is nothing you can do. Those so-called dog lovers say they love dogs, but who dares to take responsibility? If there is such a thing The Dog Lovers Association has come forward to take responsibility for the behavior of people being bitten by stray dogs across the country. I don’t think there will be so many people clamoring to catch the dogs.
Ownerless dogs are responsible; owners of owned dogs are responsible
Enact animal protection laws early and fines for abandoned dogs. Are there so many stray dogs? They are not creatures that appear for no reason. .
Since the killing of stray dogs is an accident, then humane eradication is justified.
Killing stray dogs is to protect people. Human life is greater than heaven.
People who make blind analogies to things that cannot be compared in themselves have problems with their logic.
One blogger said that the current situation feels like women’s rights cannot do anything about animal protection! Isn’t the fighting power of women’s rights quite strong? Or is it a meal from the pot that they all eat?
When others suffer, he becomes angry and angry; when he suffers himself, he angrily denounces injustice.
Since it is an accident, it is reasonable to take precautions. If there is a hole, fill it in and catch the dog.
In fact, the solution is very simple. As long as the law stipulates that anyone who raises a dog must buy a house for the dog to live in (at least thirty square meters) when the dog is alive, and must buy a cemetery for the dog after the dog dies. Otherwise, it is illegal and the dog owner must be sentenced. I would like to see how many dog lovers there are left!
Isn’t it enough to just fill in the hole?
Here I have to mention the Dog Meat Festival in Guangxi, I love it so much
Only dogs think that dog rights are greater than human rights, right?
Where is your mother? Will the insurance company cover it? Hahahaha, I look up to those insurance companies so much.
There is a pothole on the road and an accident occurred, so the pothole needs to be filled. There is her mom on the road, so I have to ____
Your screenshot makes the little fairy climax on the spot
Since this is a set of remarks, if there are holes to be filled, and there are dogs to bite and beat the dogs to death, there is no problem. Why did it end up in an accident?
If there are holes, then they have to be filled in, right?
“Take it hard”
If there is a hole in the ground, you can ask the municipal government to take responsibility. If a dog bites me, I can only say that the dog meat hotpot restaurant is responsible.
Instead of beating them back and forth, it is better to search the whole network for abandoned people, fine them, detain them and punish them severely (but it should be difficult)
So killing a stray dog that was about to bite someone, was it an accident within an accident? It&#39;s fucking gone. fine
To prevent accidents from happening, we can only choose humane destruction.
So if there are holes, we have to fill them in.
Therefore, killing stray dogs should be treated as an accident.
I remember that if you are injured by a pit, you can contact the road administration or construction company.
The United States stipulates that stray dogs that are not claimed for a certain period of time will be euthanized. I would like to ask this xnn how to deal with it.
So whether it’s catching dogs or filling holes, just contact the relevant departments.
Who is responsible if you were beaten by a homeless man?
If there are potholes on the road, you can really find the property rights maintenance unit to be responsible for compensation.
Female boxers and animal protection are basically used as guns by overseas funds
Women’s boxing and animal protection groups quite overlap.
So what do you think the insurance company will do in order not to pay out?
She was bitten by a dog, so you just kept it secret.
As long as the fatal harm of rabies virus can be solved, it does not need to be so complicated.
bring it on! Let the Third World War begin! The world must be reorganized!
It is an accident that a man kills a dog! Dogs can’t buy insurance, so forget it, accident
Why didn&#39;t the stray dog bite this man to death?
Find those celebrities who love small animals
It is recommended that a dog that bites a human be euthanized. You want to kill tens of millions of good dogs that have not committed any crime in advance just to prevent a dog from biting you one day? Why don&#39;t you say that in order to prevent murderers in your city from killing you in the future, you should kill all the people living in that city in advance.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with it, so it&#39;s normal to deal with the accident, right?
The men in the comment section are so anxious that stray dogs that bite people can die, but can all men who rape women also die? In order to eliminate the hidden danger of being bitten by dogs, stray dogs can be hunted down comprehensively. In order to eliminate the hidden danger of being raped, can We can’t fully hunt down men. If we can fully hunt down men, then I agree to fully hunt down stray dogs.
I remember some time ago, there was a woman who was scratched when she opened a drink in a hotel and the hotel had to pay for it (I can’t remember the details)? I think maybe xxn&#39;s sprained foot really has to be paid by someone who is close to her.
When he gets bitten himself, he won&#39;t look like this anymore.
Are people who say this really 100% sure that they will not be bitten? If you want to be fair, turn things upside down and don’t speak too fully.
Correct, so stray dogs that are beaten to death or turned into hotpots are treated as accidents.
I can’t tell who is rushing around commenting on others in the comment section.
After staying with a dog for too long, the words you speak are no longer human.
So what should you do if your dog is bitten by a wild dog ( &#39;▿ &#39; )
Fully support, so stray dogs = pitfalls. If there is a pit outside the door, I must fill it in, so stray dogs should
Take responsibility for yourself
Why didn’t the stray dog bite the Chinese man to death?
If no one is responsible, take responsibility yourself. If no one takes care of it, take care of it yourself and use your subjective initiative.
Why didn’t you say you were responsible when you forgot to bring your sanitary napkin on the high-speed train?
According to the metaphysics of setting flags on Weibo, he was about to be bitten by a dog.
Don&#39;t try to reason with a dog in human skin.
Anyway, I will deal with the source of the accident.
If that&#39;s the case, then there&#39;s nothing wrong with me doing good deeds and going out to fill in holes, right? If I do good deeds and kill a stray dog when I see one, there’s nothing wrong with that, right?
If there are potholes in the road causing sprained feet, you can sue the road administration
So it’s no surprise if we kill them all.
It supports handling according to accidents, and also supports cleaning up all such accidental factors like filling potholes on the road.
It makes sense to build bridges and repair roads because of a sprained foot, and to kill wild dogs because they were bitten by dogs.
The point of conflict has changed from scolding people who don’t keep leashes to scolding stray dogs.
This is not even a number
If a hole is in your way, fill it up. If the road is broken, repair it. The same goes for stray dogs.
The owner is primarily responsible, but regarding the root cause, I think the domestic breeding, selling, introduction, and publicity of such banned and violent dogs are both responsible.
Stray dogs are directly connected to dog meat shops, getting the best of both worlds, ensuring that conscientious dog owners will not dare to throw away dogs, and there will be no more stray dogs.
Then why are these dog lovers coming out to bark again when the country is out to fill the hole?
How did stray dogs appear? People who abandon dogs are harmful to society.
So I filled in the pit in advance and am I wrong?
Are you a beggar just thinking about finding someone to take responsibility?
Why is there so many potholes on the road?
See you soon, I really can’t figure out what’s going on in these people’s heads
Will stray dogs be euthanized if they are taken away? It would be better if they were all put into a shelter together. They would have medical treatment and healthy food. It would not be better than being exposed to the wind, sun and rain.
How come these years of easy living have made them no longer considered human beings?
Judging from the comments section, the overlap between Quan Zhi and Ai Shi is simply ridiculously high.
She won&#39;t say this when she is bitten and disfigured.
If you are promoted to the insurance industry, you will really laugh to death.
I sprained my ankle during work hours. That was a work-related injury. I sprained my ankle and was lying at home for four months. What are the procedures for work-related injuries?
What to do with homeless people
Too cold to say such a thing
If the insurance can pay for it, then that’s definitely a betrayal by the insurance company’s lawyers.
Who will be responsible if someone is killed? I suggest arresting everyone first.
Is it difficult to walk a dog on a leash? Maybe, after all, he/she is tied to his/her father
If you are bitten by a stray dog, go to a dog lover. A sentence of ten to eight years is not a minor problem.
Sufficiently ruthless @Not at all tangled trumpet: Who is responsible for being raped by vagrants, criminals, and crooked nuts? Treat it as an accident and be responsible for yourself. Is it difficult to buy accident insurance for tens of dollars a year?
I was bitten by a stray dog in my community five years ago. The scar is still there, and these self-motivated people get angry just by looking at it.
If you can&#39;t understand the common people, you can&#39;t punish the officials.
I understand women’s rights and want others to take responsibility for everything.
If there is a pothole in the road, I must fill it in.
Tuli&#39;s remarks compared stray dogs to pits, which is a good analogy. So according to this analogy, stray dogs can also be dealt with like pits. The best way to deal with pits is to fill them up and make them disappear completely, so dealing with stray dogs and making them disappear completely is the best way.
Your pit is pretty high-end, it comes with navigation.
There is a saying that you are indeed responsible for yourself. Before being bitten by a dog, the only combat power you have is yourself and the people around you. This is an encounter. Water from afar cannot quench the thirst of the near, and it is meaningless after being bitten. This kind of thing should not be resorted to the official. If you think they should be killed, and you are not an old woman with a fighting ability worse than a golden retriever, then you should spontaneously form a volunteer army, purchase equipment, designate a war zone, and kill them yourself!
If you don&#39;t provoke it, the biting dog will naturally be responsible. Do you want your father to teach you this?
Do you have no idea how many viruses stray dogs spread? Or let these so-called caring people find a way to contain them. Or don&#39;t blame others for killing
Did the stray dog buy accident insurance? If not, let’s kill him.
In other words – dogs are accidents and not protected by law
Dog Companions Hold This View Don’t blame the masses for hating both your current partner and your homeless ex-partner.
Otherwise, why don&#39;t I make a donation? How about buying the urn for you?
I killed the dog and I hope the dog will take responsibility for itself. Just don’t bark.
But stray dogs are all abandoned by people, hey
It’s difficult!
The concept of secretly replacing your mother
Dog owners abandon dogs, dog owners love dogs. Spear and Shield, and then it’s the fault of those who don’t own dogs.
The mother must also be locked up and controlled.
Just tie up the stray dogs in front of their house. Anyway, if anything happens, it will be handled accidentally and he will be responsible for it.
All I can say is that it makes sense for me to deal with accidents in advance, right?
So what should you do if you are really bitten by a stray dog?
The interests of the group overwhelm the interests of the whole, and dogs are higher than people. Maybe he will say that all living beings are equal, which is simply a false proposition. If all living beings are equal, you should not keep animals in captivity at home and let them accompany you. The feeders were overflowing with love and did not want to be responsible. How could they show their love by catching stray dogs? If you are really loving, please take them home, or you can raise funds to build a shelter and have someone to take care of them and keep them there to prevent them from roaming the streets.
Who is responsible if someone beats you up when you go out?
Many traffic accidents are really accidents, and the car owners are still responsible. Stray dogs bite people intentionally, but they are treated as accidents.
The guards were scared to death. What should accident insurance pay? ? ? ?
Being bitten by a dog is really within the scope of accident insurance.
Look, my fist is coming, why don’t you dodge it?
No matter how easy it is to put it now, if you are really bitten in the end, you still have to blame the country, the government, and the management.
I asked our brothers from the police station, but they have never heard of it. Maybe the Saibo Police Station arrests them.
&quot;Point it hard&quot;
She won&#39;t say that when she gets bitten.
Harder
If a person&#39;s foot is damaged by a hole, the street will send someone to fill it. So if a dog bites someone, there is no problem in sending someone to catch the dog.
If there is a hole in my foot, I will fill it up to prevent it from hurting others of my kind again, and my feet will be flat.
The first point is that dog slaves only talk about power but not responsibility. The second point is to tear apart society. The third point is that the privileges of groups overwhelm the overall interests, making some animals have a sense of moral superiority over the overall interests of the people. The fourth point is that some people use this to engage in politics and movements.
The potholes on the road will be filled in, so all the stray dogs will be killed, no problem
Is it a problem to eliminate safety hazards?
If there are any pitfalls, I will inform the relevant departments to fill them in. In the same way, stray dogs should be notified to the relevant departments to make them harmless.
Don’t recommend me if you are a virgin
As expected, there is no way to be reasonable in this world. It would be best to use a knife.
If a Palestinian baby later becomes a terrorist, no country will be held accountable and should all support the Israelis. In their eyes, the Palestinians are indeed worse than stray dogs.
If there are potholes on the road, the municipal management unit will be responsible for the municipal road because it is stipulated that the gap on the road cannot exceed a certain number of centimeters.
If you fall into a pit, someone will fill it in. What should you do if you are bitten by a dog?
You can catch all the stray dogs in the area and sell them to get money to compensate yourself.
Partying, right?
It is necessary to distinguish the location of the bite from other factors: for example, if a stray dog bites you in a community or shopping mall, the property owner will bear the responsibility! Another example is that this stray dog is fed by someone on a daily basis. According to the law, the person who feeds the stray dog on a daily basis can be identified as the responsible person. So be careful when feeding stray cats and dogs⚠️⚠️⚠️
If there is a problem, the property management inside the hospital will be responsible, and the road administration outside the hospital will be responsible.
Are stray dogs considered a trap? Then it’s okay if I fill in the hole.
Some people are willing to lower themselves to be with dogs
Really cold-blooded towards the same kind of people
Unlucky for you
After all, it is instinct to empathize with one&#39;s own kind.
The specific reasons for being bitten must be divided, and the responsibilities must also be divided.
The security guard should sue. The &quot;Animal Epidemic Prevention Law&quot; stipulates the killing and disposal of stray animals.
The leader has not formulated reasonable measures and the leadership is absent.
Whatever the security guard did was wrong. If the stray dog injures the students, the school would blame the security guard for failing to do his duty.
support!
Leaders don’t have penises.
Really boring
Click Shenyang·Liaoning Advertising Vocational College to view more Weibo here!
What&#39;s the use of reflection, life is dead
Students can&#39;t even protect themselves from the security guards, they deserve to be bitten by dogs in the future
At this time, no one said that they should be sentenced, and the life of the animal is not life.
Goodwill in human nature is precious. Remember not long ago when a man watched a little boy drown at his feet in a swimming pool and did nothing to save him? Without kindness, you are not only cruel to dogs, but also to people.
The security guard was fired in the name of love. Does this violate labor laws? In the South, where people have always eaten dog meat, will they break the law in the name of love someday?
Every stray dog is abandoned by dog owners, so they are the guilty ones, don’t just love dogs online
Some people are really bad, they just got discovered
There is nothing wrong with proper management, but do not use the name of management to express violence by taking advantage of the topic.
I made this comment to some dog lovers on Weibo, telling them to send their dogs to shelters so that they would not be hunted down across the board. However, they were complained, and the complaint was successful. It’s ridiculous.
Who is the little girl who spreads rumors so inhumane?
Lifting A4 does not solve the problem. The source is uncivilized dog owners. If the uncivilized dog owners disappear, those poor dogs will not be hunted.
Be careful of being chased and bitten by dog lovers. Those who follow me will prosper, and those who go against me will perish.
The murderer and the murder weapon are well described.
I like spring flowers, summer trees, autumn dusk, winter snow and you every day@杨子

If you have a kind heart, kind words and good deeds, you will naturally meet good and noble people.

That’s it, you’re right, come on.
Sensual Jiang Zi
@ Liu Cong&#39;s KEY
You pay for the dog!
Not every dog bites, just like not every person commits a crime
What about people killing people? Does everyone deserve to die?
It&#39;s just that through this kind of thing, they start to openly unleash their sadistic desire for weak animals.
For those who come up and spray the dog, they will be rewarded and blacklisted.
They said, why should you adopt a dog if you like it?
These people were stunned
This group of people are not even willing to raise native pastoral dogs.
Capture the little yellow dog slaves and adopt them instead of barking. Many dog owners get rabies vaccinations after being bitten by dogs.
The innocent girl was bitten by a vicious dog for no reason, but no entertainment star has ever spoken out for her. There is no humanity in the eyes of these entertainment stars, only dog nature!
Most stray dogs are abandoned by these dog lovers
If you let them take them home and raise them, why don&#39;t they jump up?
Registering a dog is the best way. If you abandon it, you will be fined heavily.
Why does this picture look so shabby?
This is just standing and talking without back pain. There are stray dogs everywhere and people don’t care about them. Once someone takes care of them, their hearts will break again. I don’t believe that Yang Di will take stray dogs home when he sees them on the road. There are so many homeless people that he can’t control. Woolen cloth
In fact, this is also possible. Those who love stray dogs but are unable to adopt them can send the dogs to the company of dog-loving celebrities and hand them over to them. A celebrity shouldn’t abandon her a second time!
I agree. Please care for stray dogs and give them a warm home. They don’t have to suffer from hunger and cold. A star can save thousands of stray dogs by filming an advertisement in one day. Please ask the star to take the lead in saving, and your fans will follow.
what
Why didn&#39;t you come earlier?
These so-called celebrities are just for traffic
All things have spirits and all living beings are equal. Chop off the chicken head and feed it to the dog. Strongly demand the immediate introduction of animal protection laws!
After making so much money, they should adopt some of the animals they consider their ancestors.
In fact, there are many stray dog rescue centers. If you don’t have much money and need help from others, you can appeal to celebrities to pay attention. No effort is required, just provide money. People who abandon their pets are really hateful, just as hateful as people who raise dogs without civility. It is really bad to raise dogs in cities. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. I appeal to everyone not to add new pet dogs in cities, and to raise them in rural areas if possible...
Did these actors speak out for the little girl who was bitten?
He doesn&#39;t care about people, but he cares about people&#39;s playthings. That&#39;s right, they are just playthings, raised and played with.
The purpose of their talk is just to trick others into adopting stray dogs, but they themselves don&#39;t even think about it.
Yang Di dog slave, black heart
To put it bluntly, the level of education is too low
The domestic society is like this, civilization is regressive and backward. Social divisions are becoming more and more serious, and people are becoming more and more scheming.
This is really terrible, it&#39;s simply anti-human
Even fire-fighting snakes can be released... Stray dogs don&#39;t need to be killed at all, they can just be released... Urbanization has encroached on the living space of animals.
To put it absolutely, the country is too stable and life is too comfortable. If you don’t experience the cruelty of the law of the jungle, you won’t understand what survival is. The public opinion has fermented like this. It may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it must be the opposite. It is clear that people are ghosts. If you don’t say anything else, you can really do it. All you have to do is accumulate some virtue for yourself
Because many of the so-called &quot;dog lovers&quot; are those who hate children and the elderly, and even have ulterior motives.
What&#39;s scarier than stray dogs is actually free-range dogs. They stick together and are territorial.
Nowadays, people have nothing to do. If you are really free, you can’t go to the countryside to hoe the fields.
There are groups of people who just talk and are irresponsible.
As a public figure, you should proceed from reality, not just use your words, but also use your brain.
It’s so annoying to have free-range dogs. I’ve been raising dogs for more than ten years. I have a certificate for vaccinations, a leash when I go out, and I also carry garbage bags and newspapers. Unfortunately, there are so few people who can do these things.
Also, these celebrities don&#39;t need to speak up for stray dogs. They should speak up for reasonable and compliant dog owners whose reputations have been ruined by a few unruly dog owners, and for the little girl who was bitten by a dog. It’s better to work hard on your work, your voice won’t make the point.
Well said!
Your pet care provider has said good things, so you can&#39;t just talk without taking responsibility.
Celebrities only talk but don&#39;t hold back their hands
Don’t touch the back of your head when you talk! You pity the puppy, who pity the person bitten by the dog?
What&#39;s wrong with dogs
Let’s just talk about how to know whether someone will bite someone if you don’t hunt them. After so many days, has there been any news about biting someone during the hunting process? Aren’t they all running for their lives?
If I don&#39;t hunt you, how would I know if you would suddenly go crazy and kill me while walking on the road? Don&#39;t cut it with one knife. Even if someone speaks out, you&#39;ll have to give it a try.
Can you be responsible for the kid beating my dog?
Guilty first, then punishment. Don’t you understand such a simple principle?
Is potential danger the same as direct hazard? If you go out, there is a risk of being hit by a car. I advise you to stay at home for the rest of your life.
You&#39;re the one who&#39;s responsible for this
And then they all die? With so many murders happening in the world, can we just kill everyone to avoid future troubles?
Do homeless people have to sit together even if they hurt people?
Frankly speaking, it is the dog owners who should be managed!
A brainless actor who doesn&#39;t distinguish between priorities and confuses right and wrong!
The actor harmed the country!
The root lies in people! Dog owner
People are the same kind
These people deserve a bite
The level of Chinese actors is so low and their conscience so dark, it’s outrageous
It&#39;s obviously a man-made disaster, so I have to say it&#39;s a dog
@杨迪@薛之强this one is very good, please come and take a look.
This world is not just a human world
Many celebrities have pets, which touches their interests. This situation is not caused by some pet owners or even the vast majority of people who do not comply with the regulations. As a result, it seems that they became the victims. In fact, most of us respect those who keep pets and respect their preferences. But please also respect us and respect the laws and regulations.
They are the righteous ones, there are too many evil people
The actor misleads the country
Low-grade
First turn to respect, hurry up and watch~
&quot;You can dislike it, but please don&#39;t hurt it.&quot; It&#39;s true, but there should be another sentence, &quot;You can love it, but please don&#39;t abandon it.&quot;
Isn’t it right to let cats and dogs go and take care of the people who keep them? What logic!
My place is a fifth-tier city with average economic development. There are no worries about stray cats and dogs. If there are stray cats and dogs, the urban management will deal with them immediately, and the citizens are also very supportive.
When I was a child, I often had to confront groups of dogs on my way to school, and I was most afraid of the appearance of dogs. Now a family in the same building keeps a large dog without a leash. The dog barks at me several times while walking at the same time. One time, the dog owner is at home alone, and the dog confronts me, yells at me, breaks down and curses, until the owner finally scolds the dog. On a leash
One size fits all is lazy policy
How come people are killing people and quartering them and no one says anything about annihilating the human race?
It&#39;s so funny. Did any 208 come forward to speak out for the little girl who was bitten? ? ?
Dogs cause harm to people
It&#39;s time to straighten out these actors.
Do you think they don&#39;t know? It&#39;s intentional!
An actor is an actor.
Diodes, either leave them alone or kill them all.
They understand traffic
Generally, people who have done too many bad things will feel guilty.
support. The premise for the proliferation of love should be that stray dogs and raised dogs are harmless to society and others. This is the basic understanding. Obviously, this premise does not hold true. If these so-called dog lovers are capable, they can take in these stray dogs and apply for certificates for the dogs to become their owners.
The root cause of lax laws lies with the government. There are no relevant strict regulations
To put it bluntly. Actors are the playthings of the ruling class. They understand the thoughts of the ruling class best. Their every move represents the will of the ruling class. What official lady doesn&#39;t have a pet?
Actors are meaningless
well said
I&#39;m afraid of dogs
It’s all just sensationalism. As long as the people who abandon them are still there, stray cats and dogs will continue to appear. Only by legislating heavy penalties for abandonment can we solve the human problem from the root.
Stray dogs should be treated kindly and managed properly to prevent them from hurting people or spreading diseases. People who abandon pets carelessly should also be condemned. If they keep pets, they should raise them well. If they don&#39;t, they should deal with the consequences properly. Changing the lyrics in this way is a one-sided statement and can easily mislead people, because this incident does not extend to stray cats and dogs, but only to people who walk their dogs without leashes and people who keep aggressive dogs.
Highly suspect that Jewish capital is behind the scenes
Just to attract attention
It’s not okay for them to speak out for the same kind of people.
These are all monsters and monsters
Well done uncle

Does it matter if people don’t have dogs? These SP actors
The earth is not just for humans;
[Shut up, actors! ! ! 】
They are a bunch of actors with no morals. They can&#39;t act shit and can&#39;t spread anything. They should be investigated.
Throw the actors into Gaza
The country is too tolerant towards actors/In the West, they don’t dare to act like monsters
What should dog owners and dog owners do if they don’t let people go?
Please release the dog
It’s the dog owner’s fault! The other stray dogs are right! If you put it this way, if a man rapes someone, can he kill all the men?
Normally, when a mother&#39;s child is sick, she will definitely go to the streets to find good hospitals and good care methods. But in the little girl&#39;s mother&#39;s collection, she eats pet ducks... Some netizens said that there were also those who were traveling and were found to have deleted them... Really If this is the case, the human heart is no better than a snake swallowing an elephant.

Brother, but isn’t this caused by a problem with the social shelter and rescue mechanism? How can kindness be wrong? They have no concept of right and wrong. They only know who is good to them and who they are good to. This is not human’s fault. Is there so many innocent cats and dogs? Is it wrong? Our appeal to protect them does not hinder anyone&#39;s vital interests. We just want the country to improve the rescue mechanism as soon as possible and prevent so many dogs from becoming homeless again.
I didn’t pay much attention to this news, but I’d like to ask if killing dogs is an official decision?
Maybe I&#39;m not caring enough. Human life is more important to me than other animals.
Instead of going crazy online, each city should organize its own offline organization to adopt all stray dogs and sterilize all stray cats and dogs.
Objective, correct, to the point
In his original video, he said at the beginning that it was the fault of dog owners and called on dog owners to raise their dogs in a civilized manner. We don’t know the full story. Why would he expose others online like this? Alas.
Dogs are your good friends, but you can’t bear to let your best friend wander the streets?
Dogs don&#39;t come out when they bite people
@陈陈CC陈
Before the little girl was bitten, no one thought that the dog could bite. Preventing problems before they happen and preventing more innocent people from being harmed is what people should do.
@陈陈CC陈 Hypocritical dog lovers, how can you let a dog stray if you love dogs so much?
So many stray cats are bitten to death by dogs every year. Isn’t the cat’s life not life?
These so-called celebrities are just pawns. . .
It should be regulated through legislation, vaccination and sterilization should be carried out, and stray animals should not be killed indiscriminately.
Why didn&#39;t you come out to comfort the little girl after she was bitten? If you are so caring, why don&#39;t you take in stray dogs? Give them a home! How can you bear to let them dig through the garbage pile to find food? hypocritical
Stray dogs that hurt people will be culled
If the foundation has money, why not donate it to Israel as soon as possible. Saving people is important.
What does it mean to make this statement at this time? It&#39;s obviously a dog biting a person, but he&#39;s saying that you don&#39;t have to love him but don&#39;t hurt him. Shouldn&#39;t he make it clear how the biting dog and the person should be dealt with?
Some dog lovers think that being killed by a stray dog is a suicide. So, it’s a bit miserable for a celebrity to speak out for stray dogs, but still be considered to be a suicide.
Dogs should not be euthanized
Then tell me, why do stray dogs wander? Is it a problem of some people? What kind of confrontation are you making here?
Define what is &quot;torture&quot;? How many animals does the PETA organization in Western countries kill every year? Is it considered cruelty?
Isn&#39;t it better to give a stray dog a home? Is it better to just throw the dog on the street to eat in the garbage? If a celebrity is so rich, can&#39;t he do something within his ability? If you don’t say 2 million, you can just say 20,000.
How can one kill in a civilized manner? ? ? Tell Gouzi to wait where you are so you can go back to the office to get the electric baton? ?
Stray cats and dogs hurt more than 40 million people every year. They deserve to be killed. If you want to show kindness, take them home and raise them yourself.
How to kill in line with &quot;no cruel killing&quot;? //@ Sweet Potato Bear Laoliu: If stray dogs continue to roam, who will be responsible for biting people? Only adopting stray dogs can solve the problem //@陈陈CC陈: Do you have any serious illness? They just told you not to torture and kill them!
Adoption or full capture, neutering and then release (TNR, trap, neuter, release), but this requires costs. The vast majority of celebrities whose income is thousands of times that of ours are fully capable and responsible for making some Weibo contributions to society.
Cities are not suitable for raising dogs, so euthanasia is a good idea. If someone takes the blame, it&#39;s an unqualified dog owner who takes the blame.
Puppies are originally messengers sent by angels to take care of humans. They never complain about their environment, but they are always complained by some &quot;people&quot;.
Another time when I was exercising in a community, a puppy kept following me. I accelerated it, but it didn’t move even if I didn’t move. It was really scary even if it followed me. I was particularly worried that any of my actions might make the dog feel threatened. come and attack me
So stray dogs deserve to die?
There is a kind of aesthetic feeling like having fun outside and not being responsible, so they kept silent when they adopted stray dogs (but they still hope that they can collect them in a centralized manner and no one wants them, and then dispose of them without causing pollution.
Holy shit, I suddenly realized that your comment makes sense. Too many people in college feed stray dogs when they are so loving. When they are in a bad mood, they don’t even look at them when they pass by, let alone adopt them. These people won’t remember them after graduation. But these stray dogs killed a kitten when they were hunting in groups at night. This happened to me. If they had bitten a human, no one would be responsible for it.
your bottom
I have been chased by a dog. It really came at you without warning. I know it is its owner&#39;s treasure, but I can&#39;t relieve the fright. Now I am alone on the road and see no one holding it. I am afraid of all dogs. That shadow really lasts a lifetime. I won’t say that I want it to die because I don’t like it, but for this matter, someone has to come out to take care of it. If you can’t take care of it, just follow the policy and don’t beep online!
These are not the only ones who oppose cleaning up stray dogs! Our country consumes billions of rabies vaccines every year. I would not believe it if these stakeholders did not contribute to this matter.
Hypocrisy, truly
Can these people be called dog lovers? cannot
There are good people and bad people, and there are also good dogs and bad dogs.
hug you
There is a big difference between people&#39;s cognitions as long as they have a clear conscience. There are always people who can&#39;t understand. There are always people who are full of anger. You need to learn to face it calmly. Just be yourself and block out those messy voices.
Dogs that bite people can be beaten to death, but many stray dogs have eaten their last meal and hid at angles, daring not to approach people. What did those dogs do wrong? It is impossible to abandon dogs if you really love them. People who abandon dogs do not love dogs. It is the people who abandon dogs who should be condemned.

Developing first and governing later is obviously no longer in line with China&#39;s national policy. Making strategic decisions before taking action is what China should be doing now. Only steady progress can lead to long-term development, and only steady development is more trustworthy. China always remains in awe of the unknown. It can refer to the new crown control and be cautious in sailing the ship of ten thousand years.

There is no physical evidence in the QJ case after so long. Three sisters made confessions. This frame-up is a bit obvious.
I missed a sentence in the middle. Du Meizhu, who jumped out to blackmail, first hyped up love, but later blackmailed her because she was afraid of being accused, so she attacked QJ.
That&#39;s what I guessed too
Now I don’t know if Du Meizhu can be sent in with these evidences. It’s really a thief’s cry to catch a thief. I’ve never seen anything like this.

One idea is that humans in the future have discovered the huge risks of AI to humans, sent people back to the present, and asked the board of directors to kill Ultraman. Everyone is happy to see Ultraman return, but as for humans in the future, they always say, Perhaps another failed effort.
If Sunday&#39;s talks were just about delaying the return, why did they find a CEO?
Remaining does not necessarily mean that there is no problem, it may also be a temporary solution after compromise. Since there is such an obvious conflict of interest, he should not stay for too long.

Suddenly I felt that this translation could be changed. Atman would be better. Otherwise, &quot;Ultraman makes a big fuss about Open AI&quot;, doesn&#39;t it look weird?
This is just like trying to talk to you every day, but you can&#39;t afford to stop talking about it. You have to come back and ask for it.
Why isn’t there issue 55?
Watching at station B
#OpenAI founder Altman will join Microsoft# It is estimated that Microsoft&#39;s stock price will hit a record high tonight, and Microsoft&#39;s market value will catch up with Apple&#39;s market value just around the corner. Will you, little Sissy?
Looking forward to the Three Kingdoms Game!
Very busy!
It seems that Sam is just the CEO, not the person who created chatgpt. The person who created chatgpt was a female programmer. Why do you call Sam the father of chatgpt?
But the CTO is a woman, only the mother of ChatGPT
The business war in the novel was carefully planned and worked hard for decades, but the real business war was completed in half a week...
All I can say is that this CEO role has a lot of drama. Only a CTO can be considered a founder. Check in the comment section to see if the CTO is a woman. You&#39;re a man, don&#39;t show off your low IQ
I have to say that the adaptability of The Legend of Zhen Huan is so high that it can be used with everything.
I don’t know anything else, but if chatgpt is gone, I will be gone🙏
Reality is more magical than fiction
I only care about whether I have to pay to use it in the future
Microsoft is putting pressure on it, after all, it holds 49% of the shares
After watching it for so many days, if there is no inside story, I just want to say how stupid the board of directors and Ilya are to think that they can directly kick out the creative team. . . What about playing house?
So the motivation is
I have seen some related news intermittently, and finally ate a complete melon today.
Succession Season 4?
Accurately find the Legend of Zhen Huan in a bunch of words, this is my love
There is a small problem. Sliding and kneeling is an action used by players to celebrate goals in football matches, so sliding and kneeling refers to celebration rather than surrender.
After seeing him leave, I really considered whether to renew in the future. (Although I haven’t bought it yet, I will definitely buy it.)
&quot;The Return of Ultraman&quot;
The real world is always more exciting than fiction!
I feel it’s not as good as the ones in China. I can travel to the ends of the world with my sword and wear a seal on my waist.
Hey hey hey? I just learned about this person yesterday from a public account article lamenting that he was driven away... and he was reset again today? I always thought that the 360-degree transformation was just a joke...
I have 4.0 and I would like to find someone to share my burden with. Is there any one?
@The old friends are more exciting than who is fighting with that one
Don&#39;t argue. Openai is a company and GPT is a program. Everyone is right. It&#39;s just that if you directly equate openai with gpt, something will go wrong.
@Gibraltar Testing Station The webmaster is quite wonderful
I feel like there is a strong force behind this
I hope it doesn’t overturn this time
So cool
It turns out this is artificial intelligence
Wow so creative
hope everything is fine
I hope artificial intelligence can benefit all mankind
The time is wrong, it&#39;s 15:00 on Thursday afternoon. I saw Wednesday afternoon and thought I had remembered it wrong. I had obviously finished Wednesday’s class today.
Will it be the Infernal Affairs in the technology world?
Interesting
I tend to believe that if AI gives birth to consciousness, current humans will probably be unable to recognize and distinguish it. Therefore, I also agree with super-alignment. We cannot put the key to the door in the hands of a few people because of commercial interests. But this point is currently unsolvable... So the final bottom line is to physically isolate all AI from the Internet. At least it can buy humans some time.
Teach humans martial arts
2023A is at the bottom of the world again
But it’s okay! Humans are sentient creatures

I thought big companies were very cautious in their news. Why do they keep repeating
It&#39;s like a joke...
Talents still need to be retained, and I hope they will get better and better.
This change is a bit surprising, but I hope they can get better and better
No wonder Bill Gates is so valued by the village chief. He is treated as an old friend and has many visits.
The global system built by US imperialism is actually beneficial to both China and the United States, but as our country is the world&#39;s largest industrial producer, it must be very profitable. The United States relies on the financial dollar to harvest the world. When it reaches China, it does indeed reach an iron plate! So Lao Mei is extremely unhappy and doesn’t want to take you to play.
Make friends with rich people, but also unite forces that can be united.
Yearn for American emperor, understand American emperor, and become American emperor.
@木有荞头木有狠面
Don&#39;t talk about martial ethics, American imperialism.
You still need the institutional version of 365 to use it.
What&#39;s weird? When the system established by Duke Huan of Qi began to no longer bring benefits to Qi but became a drag, it happened to be the time when Jin could rise based on this system.
Want you to say?
Can individuals subscribe to this 365?
what does google say
Can Microsoft’s AI withstand Chinese regulation?
Really been waiting.
There is no problem at all, it’s perfect hahaha
Very ambitious
What brand is it? Why haven’t I heard of it?
Under what conditions can a whole-house smart home be used?
good
Let&#39;s take a look at the stuff
Looking forward to it very much
This smart home is so attractive
There is really nothing wrong with this, hahaha
Very ambitious
The tone is not small, the ambition is very big
Let us devote ourselves to a great cause together
I really agree with what you said and support it very much.
Let&#39;s do big things together
It&#39;s really good
Like it! Awesome
ChatGPT is a tool. Use it correctly, save time and cost, and unleash more creativity. Artificial intelligence improves productivity
A beautiful letter, while I see the controversy surrounding ChatGpt stems from anger and apprehension about the possibility that human spirit– including our imagination, creativity, and consciousness–can be decomposed, simulated, therefore replicated by a machine.
Hollywood is fast, script arrangement, arranging some politically correct elements and adding some beautiful women, it is a hit movie
It&#39;s time to take out this picture. It turns out he is Ultraman Jack.
@aurantai is laughing so hard! ! You were still talking about this yesterday
Because my ranking even has Kabuki 2020
Although Haru is not the CEO of Yizhao Games, he even takes on the role of N. In some episodes, Gaku and Rinrin speculated/distrusted Haru. Why can’t he represent the first generation of open AI (you) and even saw it on Twitter? Those who have experience with start-ups say that Yizhao Game looks very interesting.
Damn, this blogger turns out to be so handsome.
It turns out that the blogger is so handsome. He switched from a color fan to your color fan.
Three chefs are ecstatic
Why do bloggers roll their eyes at me?
It turns out your avatar looks so much like you
I love Landa, Landa is so beautiful
mighty heroic
What is zhulu.com
Thank you, this is the first time I know the blogger looks like this
Beauty blogger
Is Lan Xi really the same age as me? He looks like my eldest brother-in-law who is in his forties
What is zhulu.com? .

This story is too dense, I need more money
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
OpenAI Wolf
Hahahahahaha
Have a serious illness
I&#39;ve seen the ending. This guy ended up selling pens.
I don’t remember what the ending was, it didn’t seem very good.
Returned
Ultraman&#39;s return to OpenAl is not a good thing, it shows that Ai has deviated from the track and is out of control.
Hahahahahahahaha laughing like crazy 🤣
Gree&#39;s Wolf
Why do these people look exactly the same?
...I thought it was some kind of Ultraman
Less than half of them are Asian
The path of AI will not fundamentally change because of Ultraman or anyone else. Different people lead AI development, just because of the speed of AI development. Musk’s Mars immigration is to put eggs in separate baskets. Whether AI will be conscious or not is irrelevant. There is no need to consider whether AI will exterminate humanity. If it would exterminate humanity, humanity would be powerless to resist. Human nature is evil and unstoppable.
Came to see
OpenAI, which has caused heated discussions in this period,
Thanks for sharing
Is Microsoft so powerful? Looks awesome
Haha what an interesting video
I think it&#39;s unlikely.
! Do not believe
? What&#39;s going on? Someone come and tell me.
is this real? He actually wants to rule the world, I can’t believe it
Hahaha, I learned it too.
Microsoft&#39;s ambitions are not small. They actually want to rule the world again.
Good guy, I don’t know if this will come true.
Microsoft’s ambitions are not small! You actually want to rule the world, that’s awesome
I think it’s unlikely
Ultraman is going back again. He can go back after making peace.
Are you all this crazy now? Everyone wants to rule the world
Ultraman is returning to OpenAI as CEO? Really? Are you sure!
I have to say that Microsoft is great
A day of increasing knowledge
Hahahahahaha, it’s impossible, you still have to pay attention.
Increased knowledge again
It&#39;s impossible, Microsoft can&#39;t do it
This really helped me understand more, right?
What does it mean? I don’t quite understand what it means.
Everyone should pay attention to Microsoft
Staying back when Microsoft ruled the world...
My mind is stuck on when Microsoft ruled the world...
I see, I gained knowledge again today.
I think it’s impossible!
This guy is really awesome.
Let’s learn about it in detail
This reversal speed is breathtaking!
The technology industry is more interesting than the entertainment industry
Yes, development is the last word ~ I stand for Ultraman
Okay, now I know how to buy stocks.
this. . . It&#39;s like child&#39;s play
I feel that Ultraman is not as good to OpenAI as Steve Jobs is to Apple.
OpenAI’s “coup” is so exciting
Will there be another big reversal tomorrow and join forces with Musk again [Wangchai]
I completely understand, so clearly, so clearly, even the distance of this relationship has been taken into consideration with my awesome combing ability.
When I saw that even the queen had signed, I was down. What does this mean? You kick people out of the harem and then you also want to go to the new harem? ?
Ultraman Sam is dead and I am now Ultraman Jack.
Chao Jiang is a five-star fan of The Legend of Zhen Huan, right🤣🤣🤣
Never watched The Legend of Zhen Huan
There was an issue of Dead Life E-Sports that was similar to Legend of Zhen Huan, but the reviews were very poor. Everyone has not watched it and can’t understand it.
To be honest, putting the original name is much better than Chinese. Each translation is different. In the end, you have to convert it back to the original text.
If you say that, I will understand immediately.
It&#39;s written so clearly
I thought An Lingrong would be expelled from the palace and become a commoner.
Although I haven’t read it, I think you summarized it well.
OB is happy
I understand it
Former CEO of twitch: 嘤嘤嘤
So many Asian faces
This metaphor is wonderful
A bit awesome
I understood it immediately
My only focus is Ultraman
An Lingrong is so bad
What is Ultraman Sam?
Everything can be done by Zhen Huan [Hello Teacher]
I just finished watching the finale of The Legend of Zhen Huan last night. It was very immersive and easy to understand hahaha
Brain-burning...
To be honest, I side with the Queen
//@Mitsuzu: This metaphor is wonderful and wonderful
Give a good review to the bad reviewer
Thanks for the popular science. Just start with the name and you’ll already understand.
You must be a female operator! Not many men have watched The Legend of Zhen Huan
@saisaixing
These are the top programmers in the world, right?
@french fries piggy bun
Thank you for the summary, so I won’t be confused.
@IiNnFfIiNnIiTtEe
I don’t understand it if I haven’t watched The Legend of Zhen Huan.
It really comes and goes
Believe in the power of light.
The returning Ultraman is renamed Ultraman Sam
It’s a good lesson for other start-ups in the same industry.
Destroy it
tho it’s still pretty stupid
After a period of time, join Microsoft with the new board of directors
He is the nephew of Samuelson, the great economist.
What about Ultraman? The universe is a family.
Microsoft wins, wins twice
It&#39;s amazing to me...
This sentence is added to the openai corpus
Has Microsoft encountered Iron Fist?
If you know gold, remember to mention Aristotle
He also thinks that it is better to decentralize power, but is his concentration of power over the years a good thing or a bad thing?
Looking forward to the sequel, okay?
What more can I ask for?
The one I worry about the most is Musk.
This kind of company appointment is just like playing games
It feels like watching 100 episodes of a palace drama in two days
How many times have you broken in the past few days? Not broken yet
Is it true that only the board of directors can fire a CEO?
Being disrespectful does not conform to our country’s characteristics.
En cultural tradition. Just like a military struggle, winning the battle eliminates the roots. Watching the American Civil War, there was a war in the summer and a truce in the winter, and the generals from both sides could still have a drink together.

The moon abroad is so round! What is available at home must also be available abroad! There are definitely some overseas and domestically as well~
You can lick this, these so-called economists are really good at it
Is there a distinction between high and low?
Respect the rules and innovate the rules
You put it like that... Children’s shoes for National Day will be sold soon.
This is not culture, this is the rule of law
dross culture
The game between academia and capital promotes the progress of human science and technology and civilization
Is it possible that similar things would not make the news in China, or that a company with such a status would not have internal strife in China at this time?
Domestic abnormal culture
That was Si Dou. Gong Dou went to Qincheng.
Qingzi: Who are you talking about? !
And poisoning. . .
If he wants dignity, give him dignity, if he doesn&#39;t, give him dignity...
rules and transparency
In other words, hot weapons are more civilized than cold weapons? Are nuclear weapons more merciful than conventional weapons? Look at the methods used by the OpenAI board of directors and Microsoft, they are all killer level...
There are also poisoners
Sweep a large area with a stick
It’s not about asking the police to put you in criminal custody. Will there be nothing when it comes out?
Many people in China have a sense of theater
Well, I will compare.
How can you eat melon if you don’t have blood, hahahaha
Many bosses will also bring people in

Please comment on the struggle between the King of Sleep and the King of Understanding, also from a cultural perspective!
Is this the rigorous attitude of economists by comparing individual cases with each other and then comparing them together?
Some internal fights will lead to ugly deaths if you don&#39;t follow the rules. Some internal fights will lead to ugly deaths if you follow the rules.
The working class loves infighting
a culture
It’s so boring. If this plot were written into a novel, no one would read it. One by one, Twitter resigned and then joined again.
That makes sense! a culture
back and forth
Why are you talking about Zhalang?
Don&#39;t understand
Is this a song from somewhere?
real or fake?
Jumping sideways and pulling back and forth repeatedly, no one left in the end.
The real coming and going

What the hell is Opern to All haha

Now I’m really looking forward to seeing more new developments about openai.
Seeing that there was something wrong with Yinbao&#39;s early trading bidding, he quickly dealt with Ultraman and was almost buried. Oh, what a pity Ultraman!
It made me laugh❗
black question mark
Ultraman returns home, seesaw Ultraman
What do you think?
Xianyu... has been deleted for a long time. Previously, my homepage had a watch inexplicably, and I had private messages asking why the channel was closed. However, I have never sold anything on Xianyu. I only sent two PLs to friends. I suspected it was a rat. I was stolen by a ZP guy, but luckily no one came to look for me.

This is how men protect each other from top to bottom. The men at the bottom use violence, and the men at the top use the rule of law.
The good deeds done by Sun Ba men are once again blamed on women.
I remember this guy had a crooked butt for a long time and made a lot of confusing comments.
Sunba ♂ is a box opened by a good brother in the body
It is worthy of saving Jianshan
Men are abusing cats and dogs, and women are being bullied online. Can&#39;t you tell who is good and who is bad in this world?
It’s so funny, Sunba opened the box to save her age, Xie Bingyi, and many female stars such as Zhao Lusi who spoke for animals. The person who opened the box was that Sunba Nan and the men’s rights organization group have been protected, but they can pour dirty water on women so quickly.
Just like a high mountain, if a man deliberately brings trouble to a woman, whoever dares to redress his grievance will be &quot;punched&quot;
Patriarchy is the smallest unit of monarchy. This incense girl really loves her manhood.
It doesn&#39;t matter, the baby boy will continue to have sons.
The two media outlets, Beijing News and The Paper, recommend unblocking them directly.
Xie Bingyi and Tang Lanlanwei were still defending their rights in her time
Gazette
Fortunately, the dirty laundry in the 21st century can be traced and documented.
Now I have to be violent online😋
The cat abuser kidnapped me, used my photo as a profile picture, used my ID number to register for Genshin Impact, put my real name and mobile phone number on TG, and received harassing text messages every now and then, who is the extreme one? Should we just pretend it doesn’t exist if we don’t say it? Fortunately, I changed my mobile phone number when I opened it for the first time, otherwise I would have to be harassed by a wave of verification codes the second time.
Daily men&#39;s pot and women&#39;s back
🧢Forcibly dunking it, if it is just a sign of weakness and there is no gender/gender/position/position, then it is really just a beating.
It’s Sun Nan’s fault. How many comments are not caused by Sun Nan. In this regard, men are more united.
@xiebingyiEvelyn
I have the nerve to mention pink-haired girls. Who made pornographic rumors about pink-haired girls?
The article on CCTV is also very problematic. We will publish the article tomorrow.
So many people didn’t even mention it after opening the box of Good Guy’s Cat Abuse Sunba.
The Beijing News has always been very crooked. There was once a certain incident that was criticized so much that it was on the hot search for many days. It is a private newspaper with a bad reputation.
The Beijing News has previously written an article analyzing feminism, and the writing and ink were in the right place, but in the end it’s still business, right? //@小鱼粉can: This is how men protect each other from top to bottom. The men at the bottom use violence, and the men at the top use the rule of law.
@久久juejuejuezong, I want to see you scolding me
Edinburgh
As far as I know, several celebrities mentioned in the article have more or less spoken out for animal protection. If they are really so-called cat and dog lovers, why bother picking them out? It would be more reasonable for someone who abuses animals to open the box. I am opposed to the extreme love of cats and dogs, and I am also opposed to animal cruelty, and I am even more opposed to using the bad things done by people who abuse animals to discredit protecting animals!
Really🤮🤮🤮
&quot;Some participants said bluntly, &quot;In reality, as a high school student, I don&#39;t even dare to say a word when I meet a girl.&quot; But during the process of &quot;opening the box&quot;, they found that they seemed to have the power to &quot;control others.&quot; &quot; It often appears in communities composed of &quot;extremists&quot; in the food circle, women&#39;s rights, and dog lovers, and it has become their secret code for resisting people who are &quot;not of my race.&quot; Why is it still inconsistent?
Call yourself Pringles Feminist and come take a look.
CCTV also has the latest case of &quot;unboxing of human flesh&quot; in the same paragraph, involving 18 provinces and cities, and the main actors are all underage
Do you still remember the boy he reported that public opinion pointed to, the boy who committed suicide?
@鸭圣婆@Special Fund for Companion Animals@Holding Claws - Free Adoption of Cloud Pets
The girl with pink hair is called Zheng Linghua
@The mute key fell and I was speechless
It&#39;s so funny. The ones that I opened the box include Vitamin Metabolism Bingyi and the female star who speaks for animals, Zhao Lusi and many other female stars. The person who opened the box was Sun Ba Nan, and the men’s rights organization group, they were able to pour dirty water on women so quickly.
Since when did women’s rights open boxes of human flesh over men’s? ? ? ? ? Isn’t it always Sunba Man who opens the box?
I really like that there is a dark and authentic fat rat behind the man&#39;s back, right?
Characteristics of classic men’s pot and women’s back iDingbao
I’ve only seen women’s rights being opened boxes like crazy, but I’ve never seen any women’s rights open other people’s boxes. If women’s rights had used box-opening flexibly, would they have been so angry with men like this?
They are all &quot;stunned&quot;, have they forgotten what Tang Lanlan did with human flesh?
It’s best for women’s rights to really know how to open the box
CCTV also has the same paragraph
The classic man fucks the girl, this is what the short guys do every day
This is why I don’t understand pink feminism
Akaashi&#39;s stuff
The one with the letters Sxxxxxx in the building is a yin. Sisters, don’t be led astray.
I’ve saved Jianshan. Is there anyone else who doesn’t understand what’s under the skin?

If you say a few words about women’s rights normally, you will almost go to jail, but you open someone else’s box [Eating Nang]
Men especially like to pass the blame to women
edin
I admit that I opened it. I opened the urn of this editor’s biological father.
The way we are here, either the woman takes the blame, or jwsl takes the blame, () he will always be innocent.
Short collection of favorites, taking credit for good deeds and blaming others for bad deeds
Forget about the rice circle, but have you ever seen any dog lovers or feminists open other people&#39;s boxes? Aren&#39;t they all dog abusers and aggressive people who break their defenses and then kill others with human flesh?
The latest case of &quot;human flesh unboxing&quot; involves 18 provinces and cities, and the main actors are all minors. CCTV also said the same thing
The video was censored…
I don’t know why the display was deleted.

I think one of the sisters went to the security office to investigate this matter. The security office was very cooperative. I hope this person can be found soon!
I hope that Weibo administrators can identify the urgent and anxious problems of the people, promptly urge local government agencies to solve the problems in a timely manner, take legal procedures to clean up the network for malicious defamation, and have a discerning eye to help vulnerable groups safeguard their rights.

The members of S11 and S12 didn’t have any bad points. From the beginning of S13, they let themselves go, right? They were like a garbage collection bin, collecting everything.
Because the copywriting is written by different people, the level of the copywriting varies. In fact, Yuequan Huai is a good example. The plots of level 95 and level 100 are simply two people. Even if they are crazy, it is not that outrageous, but Jiulao The plot of the hole prevented the villain from being destroyed in the end, which is equivalent to the return of the circle.
Seeing professional complaints is a relief. Gay Fan Yang is the most annoying NPC. I even kicked out Chi Zhu when I wrote the article.

So you can adopt a cat instead of buying one
Ding Ding Ding, this is a violent thing. Today it is smashing a cat, and tomorrow it is very likely to hurt someone.
Our Animal Protection Association members are at the door, but no leaders from the school go out to deal with it.
How do cats die and how do people die?
It&#39;s really scary to be a roommate or classmate with such a person...
This can lead to a master&#39;s degree

Damn it, I&#39;m so angry, the school should come out and deal with it quickly!

People who abuse cats may suffer from mental illness, such as antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. They may lack compassion, love and responsibility, and lack respect and concern for the lives and rights of animals and other people.

Scumbags like Han Zixuan (student number 14430206500052) are of bad character and are not worthy of being nurtured by the country.

When I met a kitten, my brain went crazy. I really shouldn&#39;t be impulsive... Shisan ran out and got into someone&#39;s car before. I lay on my stomach and touched him, and I felt that his leg was entangled with a &quot;cloth strip&quot;. It was cut off🙉After cutting it, I came back to my senses and said, &quot;Where is the strip of cloth in the car?!&quot; Then I sat in front of the car and waited all night🙉Fortunately, it was a temperature sensor, and the owner of the car was also very nice, so I paid 200 yuan. Many pieces...
Didn&#39;t you take the old man as a warning? You did a very good job.
Your old friend just wants to send you in, so don’t doubt it.
Aunt Yuan asks for help! ! ! I can’t find lids for large 800g cans anywhere. Does Aunt Yuan know where I can buy them?
It should be illegal to just pick up the car window. . . It&#39;s a shame I didn&#39;t do it, otherwise I would really have to go to the police station.
Fortunately, Tiezi is not at home, otherwise this would be in the bureau
Hahahaha, what do you think, I asked you to pry the car to trick your wife first?
After reading this, I firmly believe that there are still many good people in the world
If you had to open the car window that day, then the blogger I am a fan of would have another identity.
What a nice neighbor! You can keep kittens in the car, and the all-leather sofa is for kittens to scratch on.
Can you write about your love story? I really like it. No kidding.
I also love cats very much
The old iron man is so good
It&#39;s great. Everyone is doing well.
Lao Tie was right if he didn&#39;t listen. It was also right to ask the police uncle to care. It would be chaotic. Fortunately, it was a misunderstanding.
Very kind old man
Lao Tie was in a very urgent mood, wishing he could grow wings on his own
It&#39;s really good. I can only say it&#39;s really good. It&#39;s really good.
As long as the result is good😁
If you encounter this kind of situation again next time, you may still have to worry about it, just in case 🙏
We are all good people!
Shopkeeper Tong said it all, you rely on your brain to do things, not your temporary emotions, soldering iron
The neighbors are so nice. No one in your property group has said anything bad about the kitten.
[bitter][bitter][bitter][bitter]They are all good people [like][like]
Love cats eagerly
All of us are good people, and you are great too. You should calmly analyze and do what you can, and don&#39;t put yourself in danger if you show kindness. If you have any problem, go to the police and use Yuanyuan as a template.
Hahahahaha everyone is a good person card
It&#39;s okay, but no matter what, it&#39;s wrong to knock on the glass. The old iron&#39;s simplicity can really kill people.
There are many good people in the community
Good people have a safe life
Indeed. I’m curious. The real estate agent came to communicate with me at the time. Why didn’t I ask the real estate agent to tell me about this?
Concern leads to chaos, understanding understands
Take a look, how could Lao Tie be the Lao Tie of Yuanyuan? Yuanyuan is still calm and calm when things happen. Only then did he avoid the dilemma of being invited to tea by the police.
This incident only shows one thing, they are all good people, including Lao Tie.
Oh, bah, bah, bah, this man almost went to jail and was spat on.
Thumbs up for you
I asked you to use tape to pull up the car window. It seems like a very technical job.
All good people
Fairy community, all good people
They are also anxious and eager. They are all good people.
I was feeling quite depressed at first, but suddenly I was moved and realized that this world is still worth it. Thank you to every cat lover for your existence.
Your neighbors are all kind-hearted people! ! !
Thumbs up for me 👍 But it’s only right to investigate clearly before taking action.
The ending is that everyone is a kind person
They are all kind people
The people in this community and the police are really amazing.
If you don’t listen to a man, you won’t suffer the consequences.
You really need to pay attention, especially to your personal safety, and don’t be impulsive.
Save Liu: Aunt Yuan almost fell into a trap
They are all very warm-hearted people.
everyone is a good person
Why is the story so sweet?
I laughed so hard hahahahaha
No, no, I feel like if Lao Tie is at home, you two should be locked up together while he rides on the lock, and you can’t give him a flashlight. You are an accomplice! ! !
What can I say? My dad felt really distressed when he saw me closing the car door too hard. Those who really abuse cats wouldn’t lock them in the car. They would just abuse them and throw them to the side of the road.
Does Lao Tie want to send you in and inherit your grind? ?
The starting point was good. Who would have thought that it would turn around?
A real man
good people good people
They are all good people, show your heart
Lao Tie is really a kind man
beautiful misunderstanding
You and your wife are good people, and your neighbors in the community are also good.
Wow! Great! warmth!
It’s true that they won’t get into trouble. It’s true that the car repair costs will make Ermaolai and the others eat a lot less cans.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I was moved to tears by the reversal
I once encountered a stray cat that fell into an empty store for several months. No one answered the call. I called 110 and was told that they could not break into private homes and could only coordinate with them, but nothing happened. I was fed through a crack in the door for several months. One day, I suddenly had a sudden idea and wanted to rescue the cat. Because at first it was the kind people from the nearby shop who fed rice and other things, but they led me astray. I didn’t expect that the door gap would be big enough for the cat to come out.
Fortunately, Lao Tie was too impulsive. Fortunately, Yuanyuan was not impulsive. Fortunately, Maomao met good people.
I only see Lao Tie’s good intentions.
Laughing Mouse, luckily I didn’t pry the car. What a great car it is.
You must never pry the car. Since the skylight is open, I should immediately think of feeding from the skylight.
Yuanyuan is also a good person
Stealing or destroying property must not be done randomly.
There are so many good people
Brother Tiezi’s ancient road is hot and spicy. Like it.
After reading this, I just thought that Aunt Yuan’s house needs an extra cat.
They are all good people
Hahahahahahahaha oh my god, I’m laughing so hard
Lao Tie is really a good person, and so are you.
This neighbor is not bad either. The car is used as a cat’s nest.
That’s right, you can’t mess around like this or you’ll be caught! Fortunately, fortunately
Oh my god, I saw you on Xiaohongshu, but I didn’t pay attention to your avatar and ID, so I didn’t recognize you.
emmmm, luckily there is a policeman. At this stage, there is no one who is right or wrong. It is indeed caused by insufficient communication. Anyway, remember to be a legal citizen.
Brother Tie shines even more @白家tun的白aunt
I’m so happy with this kind of reversal and heartwarming story
Fortunately, Lao Tie is not at home and you did not follow the instructions. There are still many kind-hearted people now.
Hahahahaha tell me what community it is in. I want to move. Why are my neighbors so loving? The territory chosen by the monkey is a treasure of Feng Shui. Everyone has love. Brother Tie is guarding it and Yuanyuan is watching.
The residents in the community are quite enthusiastic.
Lao Tie is kind-hearted, but Auntie Yuan, a little girl who is not even 1.6 meters tall, went to pry out someone&#39;s car window in the middle of the night. It&#39;s a bit outrageous. If something happens, it&#39;s better to call the property management company to handle it or ask Zoo to work with the property management people. Go
After reading the first few paragraphs, I don’t know why, but I always think that the genders of Yuanyuan and Lao Tie are reversed.
Lao Tie is really furious because of the kitten~
Cats are so cute. I hope they are all well.
The fifth cat given away. Go to sleep, go to sleep, and you will be born rich in the next life.
Only when there is nothing you can do will you rely on karma, but this is too illusory. Even I don&#39;t believe it myself
You don’t have to coddle them when they’re crazy and chatting like crazy.
Only playing with the uncomfortable scenes of one person on the rooftop and the corpse
That&#39;s right, don&#39;t you use your brain when talking? If someone is transferred by a marketing account, who will you scold?
#李智琹hun is really a cat#
Maybe because Luzi is good at constructing a perfect male image in his mind, he thinks that ♂ will also be so true, kind and beautiful. Even if the most stereotypical and weakest female image is photographed, there will still be a lot of people rushing to say &quot;she is so beautiful/she is so strong&quot;. (For example, the borderline tool heroine in the male-dominated drama and &quot;White Moonlight&quot; who died tragically in the female abuse drama)
Those who abuse cats will die a good death!
Indeed, this is why I like faker! But I still want lpl to win more
Hit the nail on the head
This software is now a star chasing software
Ahhhh, yes, yes, yes, indeed
In fact, regardless of the male element, I still like these two female screenwriters. They are my favorite two-dimensional game screenwriters... I feel that they are better than some male screenwriters (the copywriting team as a whole is also very good... but there is no love yet) Copywriters with a relatively high concentration of women, even if they have feelings, they have been suppressed more or less in these two projects, and then after being presented, they are forced to write some unwilling backstabbing
All because of money? In addition, it is difficult not to suspect that the parent company was directly transferred from Nuan Nuan or Love and Producers (In fact, part of the copywriting is quite similar to Love and Producers. It is reasonable to guess that the teacher was originally from Love and Producers) Jumped over from the otome game
Although I am called a male idol every day, I feel that when asked this kind of question, I really can&#39;t be so gentle. If you ask and answer here, I will really show sympathy for you, you are a retarded person.
Stick to what you love, dark people will never see the light
I&#39;d really appreciate it
There are women too, but there are fewer of them, and women are less likely to abuse dogs.
Your eyes are so bright, Zaizai
Of course, why do the gangsters use Ai Guo as a banner? Because they know very well that xx has this kind of virtue.
I want him to retire and retire, but I also want him to come back. He really has retired. How long can you LPLs survive?
I can&#39;t help it. There are too many people who hate me. I&#39;ve defeated all the usual gossips. Now I&#39;m trying to get through skt&#39;s skin. I can&#39;t help it. I really can&#39;t help it.
I watched two games offline. To be honest, most of the WBG fans came because of TS. TS itself has a lot of traffic. After he left, many people probably won’t watch the game again.
After Shy retires, I may not watch another game...
I abused cats when I was a child...
I also bought his book about Niu Niu’s Dragon Boat Festival, which was unlucky.
Do you want a neutered eight-month-old British Shorthair?
You tortured me so much that I started to feel motivated again🍊

He won&#39;t fall into traps at all and is very strong.
Every time a cat abuse video gets tens of thousands of retweets on trending searches, I always wonder if they get so excited and crazy in the group that it will lead to even more cat abuse.
Where are you in Xi&#39;an?

Seeing Zhaozhao say this, I was both touched and helpless... If they really knew how to listen, how could they take this path?
Oh, that’s so sincere. If they had the willpower, they wouldn’t choose to torture cats.
Let’s not talk about learning anything, just playing games every day. Isn’t it better than abusing a cat?
Supplement: August 26
As for the cat abuse case at Xiangshan Middle School, it really became a hot topic at the time, but now no one cares about it
Isn&#39;t that person a psychopath? Our whole school knows about this. He killed the kitten.
Then I went there this week and found out that the person who abused cats in our school peeled off the skin of the kitten in our school and dried the intestines on the railing of the playground.
That one was still on trending searches at that time, but those days have passed. Then no one pays attention
A really nice cat. When I feed him something, he still rubs me.
Ah ah ah, the little cat will definitely be happy in Meow Star. He also hopes that Mommy can live a better life.
What happened! ! !
If Xiao Meow didn&#39;t entrust you with a dream, he must have gone crazy playing in Meow Star and had too much fun with his friends.
The quality of her cross-dressing videos is really high and she feels motivated.
The cat abuser failed to think through several issues. 1. Killing cats will not improve your situation. To improve your situation, you must focus on a practical thing around you and at hand. If you have a mental problem, seek medical attention as soon as possible. 2. There is no value in killing cats. Even if you accept the theory that cats are so-called &quot;ecological killers&quot;, nature will &quot;contain&quot; itself every year without you killing them. 3. Killing a cat is harmful to you. The law will be improved, so stop now as soon as possible.
Cat abusers need to recall their childhood dreams. Even if you haven&#39;t done anything right until now, it&#39;s not too late to be 16 or 17 years old. If you have a dream of flying, even if you don&#39;t have a good education, you can still learn by yourself. You may not be able to build your own aircraft in the end. Being an aviation blogger is more than enough. Give it a try for 10 years. No matter what you do, time will always fly by.

He can eat, drink and sleep. He has a good temper and a good temper. He is a bit timid but won’t bite or scratch others.

Really, I feel happy when I see her, and every move she makes makes me feel so cute.
I love my sister’s attitude towards life
I really feel like I’m not even internalized after seeing my sister.
You are good at writing. I cried to death after reading today’s issue. How could she be so good?
Kitten, kitten, a lifetime is a bit too long now, but take your time.
The kitten may indeed not know who hit him, but he was just blinded by blood
Miss you brother
He also exposes his furry belly covered in blood and meat, letting you rua.
This kitten was meowing pitifully, and its eyes were red and beautiful from crying. Don&#39;t be afraid, kitten, kitten, even if we are weak, we will do our best to save you.
I wish the kitten can skyrocket to 90,000 miles
He&#39;s just a nice, loving kitten
I miss him
What&#39;s wrong with the kitten? It just thinks that those who are good to him are all members of his family.
Oh my god, bro
I cried so much
. . . . . My life is also life
It&#39;s a kitten, it&#39;s also a tiger
ε=(´ο｀*))) Oh, let’s give it a hug, meow
Being loved will make your bones and blood grow, just like the minister finally got love and regained his vitality, how much we love him
Don&#39;t be afraid, kittens, kittens, the people who love you will always be with you
Do you have to make me cry to death on this b network today?
Kitten, kitten, please cheer up
I can&#39;t save him, but I can&#39;t stop loving him

Because I prefer the kind with stronger sweetness.

I shouldn’t be able to squat down when I’m laying out the plate.
It shouldn&#39;t count. If you want to go out, squat down.
Probably not, I will squat and slide (if there is one)
It shouldn&#39;t be counted, it should be a good price, so I&#39;ll sit and squat by the way.

The princess said that the card must be turned into 195, and everyone present must help her.
Putting aside everything else, just starting a discussion group is already very
Are we the ones who talk too much?
Interesting [Hot Selling]
Five people in the audience were hanging up, but the princess ran by herself. If she didn&#39;t cross the line for a long time, she had to wait for someone to fulfill her 195. Sure enough, she couldn&#39;t wait any longer and started running. When the princess saw this, she immediately crossed the line and won 195. I was so happy that I said something disgusting after crossing the line for the second time. I thought about it and it was right. I was even caught by the princess and asked to apologize.
p5 &quot;Don&#39;t set the settings to not allow adding friends&quot; I laughed so hard that I wanted to call the sister group to attack, it really looks like xxs

Stay away from princesses who only drag discussion groups and let others know when they don&#39;t agree. Don&#39;t set up princesses that don&#39;t allow you to add friends. One thing is the same thing. Find someone else&#39;s CP and wait to see if they leave. What&#39;s the point?
This girl&#39;s team...will I get scolded if I tell you?
What does card 195 mean? Is 195 the ranking? I don&#39;t understand. Can someone explain it to me?

🆗 Very boring melon
Didn’t you say you weren’t your boyfriend in the afternoon?
Didn’t you say that he wasn’t your boyfriend?
I heard that he&#39;s not her boyfriend yet
Participating in the lottery will make your legs hairy.
Everyone was so angry that they had been arguing for so long over nothing serious.
Everyone who participated in the lottery was also blocked by him. Then he also posted a post about the lottery saying that we are all other people’s leg hair.
So that&#39;s it
Not my boyfriend, he said it himself later
If he&#39;s not his boyfriend, why should he apologize on behalf of the girl?
Isn’t this post finished in the afternoon? Why did my time playing games get fermented again?
What, the prize in the draw is leg hair. I have participated in so many draws that I don’t even know whose leg hair I have.
What a rotten melon. I originally thought it would be over in the afternoon, but I didn’t expect it to have so many consequences. I have the words “Be careful in your words and deeds” engraved on my forehead. Today I vowed never to comment on emotional posts again.
And one girl’s comment was particularly accurate: She asked others to report to bed when they were not her boyfriend, but she blocked other people’s normal comments. Later, she got into a fight with this girl again, and went to the normal emotional posts posted by others, saying that if she posted them, she would be scolded by a group of people. . In fact, others only say how good she is, and it’s not like she is not allowed to post normal emotional posts.

Hahahahaha, I participated in a lottery and was blocked for no apparent reason.

This man probably thinks she is very unlucky, she is so embarrassing.

She loves to be in tune with her so much that she always feels like others are playing tricks on her.
Pigeon asked, &quot;What, what, what?&quot; It&#39;s just leg hair, don&#39;t get too crazy.
It made me laugh so hard when I saw that I was also blocked, so I commented, &quot;Don&#39;t be so in love, hahahahaha&quot;
If you have a glass heart, don’t go online and post to ask for opinions. If you receive comments that you don’t like, just talk nonsense and bully 800 people over trivial matters [reading books]

Is she that young lady who cheated with her boyfriend?
👂🏿👂🏿👂🏿
It&#39;s just that a woman recommended a companion as a &quot;friend&quot;, but she was actually her partner, and their team ID was a very disgusting and vulgar name. Then this woman posted something in 🍵yan🍵 saying, &quot;Wives, I really hate men. I feel so disgusted when a male boss praises me for being cute.&quot; Then the wives said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you all screwed up?&quot; She turned around and deleted the post again. I started asking if I would give my boyfriend Di Renjie skin as a gift.

A typical person who burns bridges when crossing the river, rude, ungrateful, and most likely a person who is hated by others in life.
It is not the problem of the person asking for help, but the relevant units using deletion of posts as an element to solve the problem. The bullies are not condemned, but the weak are labeled ungrateful and paraded online. This is the virtue of man.
So it&#39;s better not to meddle in other people&#39;s business. Whoever is good will be taken care of, and whoever is naughty will be unlucky. It’s not worth mentioning the boundary. @ Shennongjia Mountain People’s Court: There are so many “gong girls”! Chicken thief!
Wouldn&#39;t you use this tone when asking for help?
It’s snowing lightly today. I wish you warmth in the cold winter, happiness and peace.
There is no justice in this kind of people&#39;s hearts, only a little bit of pitiful selfishness, as long as they are satisfied!
This kind of behavior is more than just burning bridges. There is no gratitude in the heart, and they don’t even say a word of thanks when expressing it. It seems that some people only treat themselves as human beings when they ask for help. When they receive help, they forget how to be &quot;human&quot; as soon as they turn around.
That should...? I really don’t understand something, please give me some advice.
Some people are indeed worthy of the suffering they suffer
Poor people must be hateful!
In our Cangzhou dialect, this is a &quot;fucking person&quot;!

Burning bridges across rivers
I can’t help but think of the scene when I was trapped on the bridge between Beijing and Yanjiao during the epidemic.
Wouldn&#39;t it be tiring to say thank you or for taking the trouble?
A blogger in Dalian also encountered the same thing. He asked for help to expose it, and then the person involved received hush money and nothing happened.
@Autumn Moon Boundless 04: A typical person who burns bridges by crossing the river, being rude, ungrateful, and most likely a person who is hated by others in life.
Why we can’t forgive others on the Internet
The news about Liu Xuezhou in the Beijing News was also completely deleted, and the words &quot;Liu Xuezhou&quot; could not even be mentioned in the comments section of the Beijing News.
Typical burning of bridges across rivers
With this kind of birth, I think everything should be done, right?
It’s not a thing, so I keep a dog
There is not even a special word of thanks. The society is still too kind to him. I wish him that he will be beaten alone in the future.
Crossing rivers and burning bridges, ruthless people, aren&#39;t you afraid of encountering ghosts in the middle of the night?
If this thing can make him an enthusiastic person, it will be worth it. In the pursuit of fairness and justice, everyone has a voice.

Today I had a post that I received. Someone also received it in my comment area. I deleted the comment after receiving it, thinking that I didn’t see it. It’s so shameless.
Send her to answer questions
Me too, I&#39;ve encountered several of these. Sometimes they give me a lower price (a dollar lower than mine). I directly deleted his comments and blacklisted him[zhensihai][zhensihai][zhensihai]
Just go ahead and do it. The problem is that he lowered the price and I’m really speechless [Lifting the car]
I&#39;m stingy. Delete and block a dragon.
It’s really annoying for me too, so every time I see it I delete the post so that no one can feel better.

I&#39;ll go to bed first if there&#39;s no one around
It feels a bit too bad hahahaha
What does this sentence: &quot;Let me remove the fan group management I just gave to the fan group without a brand, otherwise she will withdraw from management.&quot; What does this mean? Don’t understand?
I can’t stand it anymore when I see the second article. In the past, when I quit my job to accompany my girlfriend, another boss would come up with it and say, “Oh, I lost so much because of you” and “She gave me money of her own free will.” Sisters, when it comes to dating and making friends, be wary of such white-eyed wolves searching for stingy men. They only have interests in their eyes. When we are together, you use this to pretend to be affectionate. After we break up, you don&#39;t know why you will come back. It&#39;s all of your own free will. You deserve it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it&#39;s all other people&#39;s faults. It&#39;s all what she asked you to do. She&#39;s an unforgivable sin. You&#39;re innocent.
I almost laughed after reading it. I feel that your own heart is actually quite strong. Although you have no money to buy a house and have no other skills except playing games. Although you always say that you are poor and cannot take the blame, as if you are inferior to others, in fact, you are essentially selfish, arrogant and narcissistic. . Just like in the second article, you said that you suffered a big loss. It’s really ridiculous. I don’t think you are so worried about whether 60,000 or 80,000. In the end, you negotiated and paid back 20,000 (I must remember correctly) when you chose to fall in love.
I don’t understand, but since you are leaving, I will treat you as cyberdead, and you can just live well and be my old Gr specimen in 18 and 19 years.
Although I don’t agree with your third point, I proposed to leave the group only after communication and persuasion failed that day, but you unilaterally proposed to break up, blocked me and deprived me of all my rights as a top fan and manager. , This point is in the eyes of the benevolent and the wise. But I don&#39;t want to waste any more time and energy on pointless arguments. Cats, we are separated from each other, and we will never see each other again.
If the anchor himself hadn&#39;t deleted friends, blocked people, kicked people out of group chats, and communicated well, then these subsequent incidents probably wouldn&#39;t have happened. Think twice before you act, speak carefully before you act, and act and reap the consequences.
….Go to the homepage and take a look. Esports is really a medical beauty treatment for men.
Putting aside your status as a girlfriend, is this how you treat your boss?
Don’t be too affected, cats. If you have passed by, hurry up and take care of yourself. Be happy and healthy every day and go well three times! !
It&#39;s so classic, it&#39;s like writing a textbook
You&#39;ll understand when you see the second article. He&#39;s the kind of man who writes down in his memo how much he has spent on dating. Well done.
Interest will be calculated on installments of money owed
You have a big face, the house is not bought for others, and you use it as an excuse. The second point is even more speechless. You also rejected the boss for others. If others don’t give you money, it’s not good to find a handsome person to live by. You You&#39;re also delaying others. I&#39;m too thick-skinned and can&#39;t stand it.
What&#39;s going on? Let&#39;s go well for the third time.
Who wants to know how much you have lost? Pretending to mention it casually to gain sympathy will divert attention.
If you owe money, remember to refund it. Since you think you have the bill and salary, don&#39;t be petty. If you don&#39;t treat someone as your girlfriend, even if you are a big fan and you are blacklisted, you should refund the money.
&quot;Although it doesn&#39;t have a big impact on me&quot; I don&#39;t know what I want to express
As an anchor and as a boyfriend, both are disgusting.
Sister, the heroine, don’t get hung up on the trivial matter of quarreling in 3 to blacklist it, it’s not the main conflict at all. If your character is not up to par, there will be endless quarrels and quarrels. If you are not up to it, you will just run away and do this.
It’s hard to evaluate. The previous explosive speech really shocked me.
I wish you a bright future
I am also a man. When I see you like this, I really feel that it is not worth it. You will understand later and don’t participate in these things on the Internet. As a man, doing something at home is better than anything else. Have you done the housework? Has the floor been swept? You have to abide by your duty, you know? Young boys, don&#39;t follow the bad example of those people on the Internet. When the time comes, no women will want you, or you will be cheated by a woman even after you get married. The gain outweighs the loss! Let me test you, what is the most important thing in a family? Baidu is not allowed
It doesn&#39;t matter, I love walking around, you are indeed a standard scumbag
I can&#39;t stand it. This person can find another place to eat. It is foreseeable that he will have another boss in the future💰
Why don&#39;t you read more books?
From the text, I can only see that you are mentally and financially poor.
How can he be so successful when he looks like this?
I used to cheer for WD&#39;s reunion now I just want to hit a big wall
Who are you
Good luck three times
Don’t reply again, I just want to explain who is more responsible and who is less responsible. Anyway, the other person is not a perfect victim. Wrong is wrong. It’s not just once or twice before discussing the list. You’d better make money and pay back...
Well. 6
Cat, are you stupid?
Save money: It’s mostly the woman’s fault (?)
Is this what you said in human language?
Start well and end well, without other people in the middle. Only then can we get together well and end well.
You have to save some face. It’s you who is still at the disadvantage. It’s you who blocked her. Someone forced you? You should refund the money as a matter of course, why are you pretending to be wronged?
Why do I seem to have heard this saying that gifts are not forced to be given?
water
How did you become like this, cat?
all the best
bright future
As an anchor who blocked the list of reasonable suggestions, as a disdainful man who blamed all the fault on the woman after her boyfriend broke up, but still refuses to apologize.
The new reply just repeats the old one, still shirking responsibility. She was even helping you clarify ⭕️💰. What did you say to her? I feel really bad when I see you repeatedly blaming her. Why are you so confident when you haven&#39;t even paid back the money? Who t🐴 owes you?
If you want to dance again, I can only say it again: claw
Cat, I really liked you before, but why did you become like this?
It really doesn’t have much impact, I don’t even notice your melons anymore
Alas, I didn’t understand it, but I still thank you for all your contributions to Identity V and the Gr team. I wish you a bright future.
What&#39;s going on?
Can I say that the basic profile of competitive men is like this? Three views are exploded, brothers
While enjoying the gifts from fans, you have to pretend to be noble and say that it is the fans&#39; free will that you do not let fans buy money. In your eyes, anything others do for you is wishful thinking. You don&#39;t care at all, because you have always been A cold and selfish person. If it makes you feel embarrassed to receive gifts from fans, you can refund the money as soon as you receive it, instead of pretending to be aggrieved that they forced it on me and I had no choice but to accept it.
@Zz-Gezelligheid It’s quite disgusting, but I liked it for a while
Jingnan is really a painless medical beauty treatment
If you don’t have a sense of morality, you can just sit back and enjoy the results with peace of mind.
Bad review
ohno, it went well three times, right?
I have been hanging out in the library district for a while, and I feel that my low blood pressure has been cured. I have encountered all kinds of weird things, including insults to characters and secondary creators, intense rhythm in the secondary creation comment area, unauthorized transfers, and even direct pictures. I went to the comment section of AI&#39;s original post, and now I feel that my mentality is very peaceful. I can directly report it to delete the comment and block the whole group, or directly ask the moderator to delete the post. It&#39;s so tiring to argue with each other.
Is this the secondary entrepreneurship environment cultivated by kl?
Library block + id, the buff stack is full
Me too,,,, how is this done? It’s amazing.
I was also blocked for no apparent reason. The problem is that I didn’t do anything. What should I do? Have you unblocked it?
I also had my account blocked for no apparent reason, and then it said I couldn’t log in to the site’s email notifications. How could I read the site’s emails?
It’s the same thing, what’s the result of replying to the in-site letter after the account has been banned @小红书客服
I also got banned for no reason @小红书customer service will explain

what happens
What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s wrong
what happened
How could it be that the black meat is lifting us up? It’s also Dyg who wants to lift us up. Should we have a better relationship with them?
The relationship between hero and dyg is obviously better than that of ag. Why should they give us trouble? It doesn&#39;t matter if Heizi is so dark, but his own family is involved... If I really want to thank you, I would like to thank Jio and LGD&#39;s brothers and rw
All the talk about raising eyebrows is just a joke from us fans. No one really believes that there is a team willing to lose on purpose.
Did jio say this? Oh my god, although he may just want LGD not to be beaten and lose their temper, but I still really thank Goose
If it&#39;s lGD rw, OK, I don&#39;t have any problem with hero.. How is it possible that the dyg players are all in the hero lounge? This one is indeed powerful. Mirror Show Maomao has opened very well in several waves and the rhythm is great.
If you think too much, even if you can&#39;t make it to the main round, others must also hope to win, otherwise they will lose and lose. There is no one who promotes the other and the other is let down, everyone just depends on their ability!
This version of upper, middle and jungle is really good.
To be honest, if you want to lift it up, you have no hesitation in lifting it up.
Damn it, didn’t you see the entrance to the lounge where Xiao Yi has been staying for a long time~
It was indeed Hubi who said this.
There is no such thing as who promotes whom, no matter which team they are playing for themselves, everyone is promoted based on their ability.
Hero obviously wanted to promote DYG, but their coach chose a fake four-guarantee-one for them. It happened that our jungler woke up and they didn&#39;t succeed. Maybe hero just felt that AG was in poor condition, so he chose this lineup!
I really can only count on the shooting assistant to open up the situation. I just hope that in the main game, the midfielder can practice the hero well. It is not necessary. In fact, there is no need to use the AIC hero. I feel that it is better for the shooting assistant.

Is there a bottom line? . .
It&#39;s just that the official has hidden it and not deleted it. It seems that they can&#39;t reveal too much for fear of scalpers speculating on votes.
It says it’s waiting for an official announcement. I don’t think it can be fake.

Cult // @梅花 drunk Luoyang 27325: More than a hundred people gathered together and threatened to &quot;slay Wu Chuyi&quot;. After being discovered by netizens today, one of the participants first said on Douban that &quot;the girls are having fun offline&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s not like that&quot; &quot;Really go to Amomum villosum&quot;, after netizens madly dissed this disgusting behavior, a certain fan quickly cut off the seats, reported and deleted the post. It turns out that you also know that this kind of behavior is shameless, and you don&#39;t dare to keep it for passers-by to see?
Yeah, taking a selfie
kiss you
Awesome, awesome, positive energy
This kind of self-printing of official pictures is usually done privately for fear of being hit by the official iron fist. I feel that it is more reliable to rely on friends who eat rice to communicate in private to convey the news. It is probably for profit that it will be publicized outside (whisper)
d. It takes a lot of time to hook up.
OK, I want a semi-cute Zaizai who talks a lot.
Squatting cp 17 le p estp I&#39;m not cold, I can chat and read novels, watch anime and play Genshin Impact Beng Tieguangyu (Tandyou will also be online) I like to get along slowly and talk for a long time. If it&#39;s inappropriate, just tell me directly. I like to call the tall guy after we get to know each other. There is 1 Android Magic Season. I can’t fall in love in the early stage and my brain will be clingy in the later stage. I can give gifts and the class time will not flash back to the holiday party. I don’t play Genshin Impact 56 often but it can help you control your liver and appearance. I also usually listen to music and you can listen to it together.

Butylin boron cream can be used as toothpaste and is sold in pharmacies.
Regular teeth cleaning will be much better
Dingbo toothpaste, especially when I use this to brush my teeth after cleaning, it won’t bleed.
Dingbo cream was recommended when I went to see a dentist before.
Sensodyne! ! ! really useful
Squatting down, the last time I went to the dental cleaning clinic, the doctor told me that my gum recession must be cured by subgingival scaling. Teeth scaling only treats the symptoms, not the root cause, but subgingival scaling costs thousands at a time, which is scary at first.
It doesn’t matter why you deleted the post. If necessary, it can be used as a reference
Squatting is very necessary

Of course you are not the luckiest one, but you are not the unluckiest one either. A bad process does not mean a bad ending. Even if the sun does not rise, it will be at the end of the road. It is a road that only you are willing to walk.

This is the ultimate separation.

The original piece my wife just posted is my beloved bunny!
What a melon👂
I also delete it often
ha? I also deleted a lot
Fortunately, I only deleted one post
So I always make the posts that I want to delete visible to myself, so that I don’t delete the posts and keep the number of posts.
🆘I delete it every day. Every day I feel like I talk too much and I start deleting it.
No wonder
It’s true or not. I don’t feel like I’m going crazy. I deleted it a few minutes after I posted it.
I also delete it every day

I want to buy the Xianyu store in area 207 or 208. Is it trustworthy? [Bitter] I saw the 40% discount on Xianyu store but I can’t choose the location.
of course! ! ! It should be easier to collect tickets now, and there will be a first-ever concert in Macau this time!
There is a store below that sells group tickets for the big bar. The group ticket location is relatively better.
It&#39;s absolutely possible. Are there any tickets available on the official website? If you scroll down, there will be tickets available. Pay attention to the safety of your funds and use the platform.
Sister, I have an 888 card in my hand. Do you want to take it?
You can check out the group purchase for acne scars and get a discount on tickets for two people~
Okay, okay, you go to the official website to buy it, I think the infield tickets will be released, rush duck
There are still tickets available on the official website
You can collect the ones whose location you already know.
Thank you for your support and looking forward to your joining!
If you scroll down, there should be some cheap ones.

Su Da made a great point about facing problems bravely and taking the initiative to accept supervision from the masses to find the root of the problem and solve it.
Su Daqiang, Chairman of Su Daqiang, said that what he said was very practical and reasonable.
What Su Da said is very reasonable. To solve problems, you must dare to face them head-on.
To solve problems, you must first dare to face them head-on
Face problems proactively, have the courage to accept supervision from the masses, and have clear solutions to problems.
Chairman Su Daqiang and Chairman He’s views are very practical. The key is to have the courage to take on problems.
Chairman Su Daqiang and He are brave enough to face problems and good at solving them.

If the Internet makes you unhappy, settle down first and find happiness in this life. After all, it’s just online wb and nothing will happen. Don’t be dominated by the Internet.
I think what Usaqiu said is quite right. If they don’t treat you as a friend, you shouldn’t care too much.
So why did I kick you out of the group? I don’t know you and it wasn’t the screenshot you gave me.
Opened, Floor 133. I really appreciate the comfort from all the workers. I also deleted the previous post. I think I always wanted an apology, but I know they probably won’t give me an apology. They really want it. The worker came out and didn&#39;t come to me to apologize. They were scolded and I didn’t understand what the hell it had to do with me and why they were spreading rumors about me. Now that my mood has almost calmed down, some of the bad words on the Internet are really terrible.
Baby is happy every day

Find your good friends and chat more.
Hug you and kiss you
I regard everyone as a friend. 👪When we quarrel like this, I also want to cry.
Hey, I really feel sorry for you, and I don’t know how to comfort you, because I don’t know what happened to you, and you don’t know what happened to you either.
Don&#39;t be sad, husband

Good baby, don&#39;t be sad
Workers, don&#39;t be sad. It&#39;s their fault for not being willing to communicate. They can&#39;t control their mouths when it comes to spreading rumors. The best thing is to stop reading ugly words.
What&#39;s up, baby?
What the hell, my husband looks familiar to you. You are a good baby.
Happy every day prisoner

This is all nonsense...
This engineer seems to have a relatively wealthy family, but he has paid for various breaches of contract. When he disclosed this incident, it was quite creepy. For the first time, I felt that Awakening of AI was not a movie.

There are domestic magazines as shown in the Seek magazine C version. A set of 119r original price. Do you need to change the address?
Currently there are only magazines and official weeks, but magazine pre-sales are currently only shipped by Soku. Official weeks are overseas. If you want ready goods, you can go shopping 🐟
Magazine? ? There may be some salty jade around, but it should be relatively rare.
Socool. Do you want a small card or magazine? Ready stock
I really wish you were that friend of mine
Xian/Yu who has single person photos in stock
Do you still lack friends?
At present, it seems that there are only magazines in China
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, I&#39;m just short of these two cards.
Xuan Jie won’t forget everything, right?
Who did they get stuck with again?
Thank you all for your support! Ah ah ah, I&#39;m sorting out my clothes. It suddenly occurred to me to come and help Xingxing get dressed. They dote on each other.
Blind student, you discovered Hua Dian! ! The feature film was almost not edited! ! !
It&#39;s hard to disagree
Blind student, you discovered Hua Dian
I think you are right
Sure enough, our Xingxin is the sweetest! !
Very much agree
Totally make sense! If the show were wrapped in clothes, I would probably cut them off here.
It is reasonable to speculate that when Xingzi saw the finished film, he said, &quot;You won&#39;t do anything in the later stage&quot; (combined with the Weibo post he just posted yesterday), and then his little eyes turned around and said that I still have to end the live broadcast in person. Well, it would be better to be more obvious (I can&#39;t stand him anymore) The two of them looked like they were drunk last night, and the cpf’s heart was beating fast when watching it)
Our family never seems to be the focus of editing in every program hahahahaha
Don’t you know who owns tc? Those two companies control it. Those two companies are a perfect match (yes, 2 and 9)
Stop talking, we are here to talk about ourselves and someone can cover our mouths, not even more so
There are still people in our family who are messing around with tc. Hasn’t tc been controlled by some people a long time ago?
Confuse right and wrong
Don&#39;t dare to speak in Tuanchao, that&#39;s controlled by someone
Tuanchao is a married couple who chats so much that they have been banned for a long time.
Whose family is it?
It’s so funny that she even took on side roles before, which shows that she really wants to act in movies. But even after several movie groups were packed in, no one cared about her, so she couldn’t even act as a movie character, and could only be used as a character in a web drama. Her resources have been downgraded again and again. The industry has clearly seen how much she weighs, and she is not a fool. , just for the sake of face, I want to give him a chance. He also knows these things, so he just signed the new ones this year, right?
Adou really doesn’t disappoint me, I look forward to Sister 🦐 having a good life
You were blocked or you blocked her.
It’s impossible to delete a post. The blogger’s resilience is amazing.
This operation😳
Then they offered a paid post deletion service, charging fees ranging from RMB 60,000 to RMB 150,000. In one and a half years, the two companies made a total profit of more than 670,000 yuan. ~~~Monthly turnover is 60,000
Oops, I&#39;m so shy
I was so offended by Sister Bewildered’s remarks. If there are any bad remarks in this post that need to be deleted, you can comment and let me know.
Square looked at it and said it was a line from the original novel, but fans said it was a bet, not flirting. It made me laugh. The author wrote this line in a bad way. Sorry, the &quot;acting atmosphere&quot; created by the male and female protagonists was just flirting to me. The vulgarity is doubled haha [Teacher loves you]
And how could Wang Hedi be filmed as an oil man in the scene where he broke the vase?
Oh, come to think of it, asking me whether I called the police is an indicator of whether to handle this complaint. I&#39;m being a bit naive if I&#39;m still thinking about this.
I saw that this driver&#39;s rating is 4.8 and he has been working for a long time. I don&#39;t believe that he has never spoken in such a pornographic manner when facing an all-female customer in such a long time. I don&#39;t know if other people have complained. If so. Why is he still doing this now?
When I made the call, I stated my complaint and the customer service asked me if you had called the police. I said no and was stunned for a moment. Then I thought about it. In this environment and context, where is the limit for sexual harassment to be punished? Can it only be in Does it count if it causes substantial physical harm?
When I was in junior high school, I couldn&#39;t find this group in my hometown&#39;s small city, and it hadn&#39;t become popular here yet. In high school, there were many people who liked them, and radio stations often played them. &quot;That one&quot;; the university radio station also plays it all the time, and I told my classmates that many people like them. There are several colleagues in the same department who like them. They will look at me in shock when they see me wearing SR, and some of them don&#39;t like them. The reason is &quot;too chicken soup&quot;
It is because I have experienced these times that I feel it is a pity to see some Wu fans deliberately destroying the popularity of passers-by this year.
I was so fed up with my dead network card that I peed...it took an hour to send it out.
White and skinny aesthetics, East Asian male cohesion, slut humiliation, all come from all directions,,,
I said that there are some Phoenix men who want to do evil things and pretend to be evil. They don’t even pretend to be fake. They force the eldest lady to accompany him on the bus. I clearly told him that I couldn’t stand taking the bus for a long time and would make me dizzy or even vomit. He seemed to listen. He made me angry and scolded him even though he didn&#39;t understand human language. He was stingy, poor, disrespectful, and controlling. I didn&#39;t even have half a relationship with him, but he already started trying to control my life.
By the way, he also spread rumors that Xiaoqin&#39;s best friend is being kept. After I clearly pointed out his low-quality speech, he refused to repent and did not feel that he was wrong for saying such things. In short, I hope that all my colleagues will be women and hate men. to pollute the company&#39;s air.
Oh my god...it turns out you want to complain to me about this
Ah, is Toyokawa Etsuji like this now? . .
I was also frightened (but I saw a screenshot of the bondage scene in the movie Love that looked really good, so I went to make up for it. After all, it only lasted 46 minutes...)
Although I am a handsome Nishijima, his smile is a bit silly and sweet, which is not suitable for a nervous male protagonist like Nishijongko.
When I read this manga, what I thought in my mind was Hasegawa [Awesome], and I thought his side profile was okay! And also has long legs
The manga version looks like Hidetoshi Nishijima...
I downloaded this movie and haven’t watched it yet.
Where can I read this comic? I can’t find it in the search, and I can’t find it in Anime Home either.
I&#39;ll go, isn&#39;t this Xing San&#39;er?
To the point of having nightmares🙈
Hahaha, it’s rational enough to pour cold water on yourself after finishing the job.
Help, the first one really looks like a greasy boss who is capable of sexual harassment.
This is actually the same person you fell in love with recently! !
I feel like I&#39;m drinking
...I feel the same as when I watched Ryuhei Matsuda recently
It&#39;s better to bury it. . .
Really hit me now
p1 looks like Takashi Abe! ! !
p1 inexplicably looks like Oh Dal-soo😱
It’s too scary, but some of the audience’s imagination should be kept
As expected, you still can’t look back on your first love
Men can grow old but not greasy
Now he looks a bit like Donglong’s father
Why is the temperament so different?
terrible. . .
p4 is a nightmare
Recently, I saw Etsuji Toyokawa being handsome in the 90s, comparable to Yutaka Takenouchi. Because I have only seen his recent works, I was deeply moved by the manga teacher of Hanfen Qingsato.
In fact, men age faster. Tall men are indispensable without Takakura Ken
Help, it&#39;s so uncomfortable
When I watched it, I felt that it was too old.
Just for the action of p4, there are probably no more than five men in this world that I can bear to look at (?). You have to love them very, very, very much, right?
Ah da ah
This screenshot is real
Ah, I feel so bad when I look at the stills😣
Is this a person? ? ?
It looks like Qin Hao has gained weight in the long season.
HELP！
Why force yourself?
It was extremely painful for me to read the last volume of the comic.
Is it... swollen?
To the extent of a horror movie, love is short-lived.
No, pay attention to quality
Reply to @feministonly_Positive version’s statement: Who told me to go online without you replying →_→
Teacher Yu Hua: Leave the pain to the author
Every time I write these articles, I automatically think about how great they would be if they were made into short videos. It’s not that words are not charming enough, I just think you deserve to be seen by more people!
Either the son&#39;s mother, the husband&#39;s wife, or the father&#39;s daughter.
I don’t know when and how long it will take for women to compete with men in positions of power.
There is a fight for power, not men. This may also be an issue that I often say female leaders need to think about. Seeking preference is exactly standing on the basis of male dominance and cheering for them, and maximizing interests is the essence of solving all problems.
Thinking of many moments
I also suffered from the exact same situation in the workplace, and it gave me a slap in the face. In fact, it is not a matter of personal ability, but because of the patriarchal society. [Good teacher] Although women&#39;s rights are now better than in the past, they are far from being comparable to men. To compare, why are there so many common men around us.
I also wonder if I didn&#39;t get enough love when I was a child. The pain caused by my original family was indeed quite painful in the process of growing up.
Well written
Laughing to death, and the picture posted by a fan in the comments, it’s a joke, Zhang Yuanying is entertaining herself internally
Zizi, don’t be mad to death for telling so many truths.
I would like to call it evil feedback

Have a good day

I finished typing in one breath, don’t worry about some sentence flaws @黄志中 @ 杨格丽
@黄志中@杨格丽
I added two paragraphs for you to discuss rationally.
Regarding the part about Sam&#39;s sister, there is not much splash on the external Internet, and there is no disturbance in Jianzhong. It may be that his sister&#39;s mental state is not very good at first glance, her remarks are not very credible, and Sam has come out as gay a long time ago. Yeah, no one believes in sexually assaulting my sister.
non-mainstream
It&#39;s too fast, sister
It seems that there is still a difference between company colleagues and project partner colleagues.
I would really slap him in the face and stab him in the private parts with lipstick.
Could it be that I have a too good temper? When I first met him, I thought it was because he didn’t have a sense of propriety. 🤔💦
After the cake came, Tuantuan never showed any signs of me again, but it was a bit annoying to be disturbed while sleeping.
So I stopped playing after the server started and was so scared that I pissed myself. .
Sorry, I don&#39;t want the third person to hear this.
I was scared away when I opened the server! After seeing my husband’s miserable experience, I came back to love him. In the fifth chapter, he was seduced by the vixen. ^_^
Hahahaha, apply what you have learned and immediately put it to the test in a real experimental environment [reading books]
Brother, this is sexual harassment
There was a person in Chaohua who said this and was blocked by the host because he said he was playing dirty jokes.
You can imagine the composition of his books and movies during that time
After that, my first impression was that a 26-year-old sounded like a 46-year-old. . . Uncle Xia Lei can&#39;t help but ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Let me save? ? ?
No, no, no, what a prophecy, are there no normal men in the world?
I started researching whether I am really a lesbian. I only like girls who dress him from behind.
Report to the police, sexual harassment, if the introducer of the blind date sends it to the introducer,
Print the screenshot and post it in the blind date corner
There are still men who want to go on a blind date. What kind of stuff is that?
Send the screenshot to the introducer
Oh my gosh, the lady is so nice.
I also think and feel that some of the content is a bit plagiarized.

Hey, I haven&#39;t had any offline group building yet, but I met a sister offline last week, and her screen saver is bjyx

They really stretch the crotch
They don’t provide data and don’t provide support. They can’t get anything online or offline. I don’t know how to describe it.
&quot;Gathering a crowd to sexually harass a handsome guy&quot; made me laugh so hard, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Laughing like crazy, VF gave money to a big fan to chase stars, but he also clapped his hands and praised, this is not true love, what kind of chasing is steaming, you are chasing big fans, you didn’t make enough jokes last time
They really... reported

I think they are quite fake. Isn’t this the elevator on the first floor? Where did the door camera come from to get a haircut and said it was a refill. If I believe they fired Xipi, then I am lying.
Yes, yes, next time, please don’t stare at our crane, okay?
Isn&#39;t it because of his acting skills that the male protagonist is not popular? How could someone else be so popular if he has such a good character?

Who was sexually harassed in the workplace?
Average acting skills
What&#39;s this?
What moral bottom line can there be in saying that grooming one’s hair is a matter of personal preference?
Such a good character is lost in vain
It’s not Zhang Linghe who is comparing his heart here.
Just watch the show! There is so much to say, pay attention to the actors! I think they&#39;re all pretty good.
Stop jumping and come to Ning&#39;an Rumeng to see Xie Wei
Aren’t the plots of these episodes all about Zhang Zhe? It annoys me to death!
Yes, it&#39;s really not popular. It&#39;s better not to be popular. It saves him from breaking through the defense with just a few small achievements.
Husband, you are my mouth ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, does a certain teammate think that the whole world is full of dream girl fans? When you first come up, no matter whether they are 37, 20 or 20, everyone is in the same mode. Really? Is it sincere?
Sometimes I randomly come across some autograph signing videos, and I feel like I’m being kissed on the face by a strange man.
He&#39;s pretty, he was totally charming to me when I signed him.

Counterattack in progress
It has been seventeen years since I supported telling the truth. This is the first time that there is a limit to tolerance.
Looking back, I cried a lot after the quarrel, but the boy seemed to come to comfort me after class.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That episode of Tuoli made me not want to watch Japanese TV series again for a long time.
Yes, I met several people who exposed their yinpi when I was in junior high school.
Is anyone harassing you?
There is a hidden struggle for power and control in intimate relationships and parent-child relationships. The caregiver controls the resources and, through the distribution of resources, obtains the dependence and control of the fostered person. Dependence on the other person brings a sense of security and control. It&#39;s a bit like a luminous body. The light shines outward, but you can&#39;t see or feel it. But if you have a mirror, you can reflect it, see your own light, and be warmed by your own light.
I can&#39;t always find true despair, I can&#39;t stand it anymore, and I have a fake feeling that I can finally take a breath.
Bad work experience, or the psychological inability to accept the career gap, kept her in a state of despair.
After watching some clips, I felt like a loving mother and a filial son. I almost forgot that my younger brother is actually an adult too😅
She seems to be trying to narrow some of the gaps (age? strength?) between her and her mama&#39;s boy by playing the role of a silly and sweet love brain, so that the outside world, including the other party, believes that the relationship is stable and prevents the other party from abandoning her. But she was the one who didn&#39;t believe it the most. She has occupied both the entertainment industry and the sinking market. The blow of cruel reality, the gap between becoming popular and outdated. The obsession to prove that you are living a happy life. It feels like buying zombie fans for love.
From a really friendly perspective, I remember she seemed to say that taking on commercial roles was the most shameless way for her to make money. I don’t know how to understand this sentence. Does acting consume more intrinsic value than commercial acting?
Don’t be a mom in an intimate relationship. No matter it is a sister-brother relationship or any kind of love, it all starts with the man&#39;s dedication.
I remembered that Wang Caihua, who was in the beef market in the early years, was also a person with strong life force like Liu Xiaoqing.
Jin Sha said on Sister Lang: I have no choice, I want to support the team... It feels like it is not a big heroine who supports a team, but she is manipulated by the team as a puppet.
Personally, I think it’s a script, and ordinary people can just read it! So early in the entertainment industry (although it was just the record industry) and had a small reputation. If you have talent, you also have to be good at it. For example, will the female president of the company be deceived by the little naughty dog? Won&#39;t! Just take what you need. Because people with strong careers cannot be so stupid, and they have more split personalities. After this variety show, Jinsha became popular again
Everyone just gets what they need. Jinsha knew very well that there was no future. Once Zhu Dan asked about a question similar to family and marriage, the boy in the show instinctively blurted it out without being prepared, which roughly meant that marriage was a very distant thing and he had never thought about it.
No wonder a netizen on station B commented that her boyfriend had some needs that he couldn&#39;t express and expressed them through Jinsha&#39;s mouth. So that&#39;s it.
You are absolutely right, it just has no vitality and no power.
Jinsha has never been very clear-headed, or women really invest too much resources because of false love. The victims of the pig-killing plate are all of this type. They are not called love brains, they are called people who cannot control the risk of intimacy...
Raise as a son. //@Girls’ Big Lion: The investment of older men in younger women is limited, because there is a cultural paradigm of “concubine” for reference, and the investment of older women in younger men is likely to be several orders of magnitude higher. , because their reference paradigm is children. If she loses both her life and money in the end, will she not regret or feel resentful? //@Lang Taotao: I can&#39;t always find true despair, I can&#39;t stand it, and I have a fake feeling that I can take a breath at least.
But this kind of person will only feel sorry for and pay attention to men. As long as it is a woman, she will be indifferent and even add insult to injury.
Lin Daiyu uproots the weeping willows, which will only make her sick.
What did she say? After seeking benevolence and receiving benevolence, the first thing she thought about was the decline in her thinking.
I think her choosing shorter and faster methods (the younger brother can see the current emotional value of her youthful appearance) is a sign of low effort. Choosing smarter people is a more complicated game.
Recently, Honey has watched a lot of videos of Xi Mengyao and He Youjun.
Be fierce! Protect your treasure!
It is true that some men are always verbally harassing me. I was walking on the road with my friend before, and a man passed by on an electric bike and said to my friend, &quot;Who are you showing your big white legs to?&quot; This made us sick to death.
Hello, I&#39;m very sorry to bring you a bad experience. Tutu has sent you a private message for more details, please check~
I am also most afraid of walking at night, so pay more attention to safety.
This is a good suggestion, I hope it will be adopted
Because verbal sexual harassment is less likely to occur when a third party is present than when both parties are present. Moreover, sexual harassment is obvious when hearing such a color topic. You can directly retaliate or not answer, but sudden physical contact is really serious. It’s hard to prevent, and it’s really disgusting
I feel like there is something going on between Fang Lu and Mei Daliang. I think there are a few dialogues in the first season that foreshadow it.
The heroine&#39;s mother was killed by her mother-in-law, but I didn&#39;t think she was very sad. In the last episode, she still had fantasies about her husband.
The career line of the heroine is relatively satisfying, but the emotional line can really piss people off. This show seems to put a lot of pressure on the breast glands!
I rather like that Boss Zhou pays attention to morality in a limited character setting. The rest, the male protagonist, Qiu Hua and the nanny are more realistic, like real lawyers, workers and climbers. Fang Lu is a bit idealistic, the rich second generation is even more floating, and the female protagonist is divided. On the one hand, he relies on family conditions to be an optimist and has a love-minded person like the second-generation rich man. On the other hand, he is very enterprising and always has luck to turn danger into safety.
Han Lu! I only recognized him as the boss in Jingfei Guo and Yu Huanshui&#39;s drama. At first, I almost mistaken him for Ji Yangyang&#39;s father.
The heroine is so holy
I think Fang Lu’s image will be reversed in the second season
The heroine is an ideal character, she doesn’t actually exist
I quite like the heroine.
Exactly the same order of preference as you
So I don’t want Fang Lu to become a villain
I also like the male protagonist. When I first opened it, I thought it was another boring character like the one in Chaoyang who knows everything, but I didn’t expect it to be quite interesting. The heroine just wanted to compliment her, and then she started to miss her husband.
If he can push Dajie vx to me, I can postpone the secret veil operation
I think Danchou is here to take drugs, not to eat shit. I’m going to fuck you.
It pisses me off so much. Tanaka Kouki looks so disgusting. I have never seen SD work so hard to cram a two-page plot into 10 minutes. Why don&#39;t they give him a single about being ugly? There is no shortage of this one.
The crew who don’t know how to film Dan Chou are destined to fail👎👎👎👎👎👎
This shit kills me. The first four episodes were pretty good. I’m sick of feeding shit like this. Go to hell!

Next time you turn on the recording on the spot and play it in front of him. If he doesn&#39;t say anything, just say: &quot;Go on, I&#39;m still waiting for your advice. Many female colleagues don&#39;t pay attention to maintenance. I&#39;ll help you spread the word so that everyone can pay attention.&quot;
Is there anything I can’t fight against? No wonder they say teachers are easy to handle. I still complained about the unfairness of the leaders of the Political and Education Department and they came to me and gave in within half an hour. After several months, they didn’t give me any clothes. What are you kidding me about? Next time I will record it carefully and send it to the District Discipline Inspection Commission’s mailbox along with his work information, and give him a punishment. I will go even further and send him to the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission’s mailbox. Do you still want him to spend his old age in peace?
you&#39;re not wrong! First of all, don’t doubt yourself! Avoid being alone with him and try to get hold of the evidence!
He&#39;s not a director. He just recorded and threatened him in front of him. This kind of person bullies the weak and fears the strong.
Start recording and report him. If he wants face, don&#39;t give him face. He&#39;s retiring anyway and can&#39;t put on your shoes.
Why is there such garbage? Record it and report it.
Recording, toughness, a person who is so wretched and has obvious pigtails, but also has value, handle him! You must be thicker-skinned than him! When a male teacher in our office who was about to retire harassed me, I immediately went crazy. He was frightened and he no longer dared to talk nonsense. Such people are bullies and shy of others.
Reminds me of Xu Jie who lusted after beautiful legs.
I don’t understand why you can’t resist this. Scolding him is just to relieve your own anger...
This is a person-like person
No, can he expel you or do something to you?
I&#39;m sorry for your misfortune, but I&#39;m angry that you don&#39;t fight. Whenever you call him loudly in front of him: a greasy, wretched middle-aged man. It&#39;s better than asking everyone here. He doesn&#39;t feel ashamed. You are the one being harassed. What are you afraid of? Does he pay you a salary? ? ? Seeking help from seniors? Do they have a stake in you? To succeed, you must first go crazy! ! ! The soft persimmon keeps being pinched, what should I do? Ding like a copper pea
Recording recording. After I was admitted, I went to the leadership office and cried at the Education Bureau. They are not afraid of being calm and defending their rights and speaking the truth, but they are afraid of you becoming hysterical. There is a male teacher whose mouth smells worse than the toilet
I have the same question. I am only a special employee and not an editor. I encountered verbal sexual harassment from the principal and was persuaded to drink. Because I have the opportunity to be admitted to the school&#39;s establishment, but I don&#39;t want to be stuck in a small shoes and make trouble, I would like to ask if there is a good solution.
I don’t understand. Reputation is very important within the system, especially in matters like this between men and women. If you don’t have a good reputation, you basically can’t be a leader. So many people know what he is doing and he still dares to act unscrupulously, even if he hasn’t been punished. Let&#39;s live it
I would say that as long as you don’t have a handle, fall out in person or leave evidence to the boss. But if you shrink from his rhetoric or school rumors about career development, then you will feel uncomfortable and tolerant. And to be honest, even if you just say that you have dinner or work together, they will talk about you behind your back. Don’t underestimate your school colleagues’ gossiping ability
The recording is always on, let him retire and go to waste
Recording, I am not a big leader of the Education Bureau. I really treat myself as a human being. I should criticize Zhao. The more you are afraid of him, the more arrogant he will be. If you make trouble, he will not come to you.
It was so disgusting and I wanted to treat him the same way I would treat a student. I frowned and asked him, &quot;What did you just say? Come to the podium and say it again for everyone to listen to.&quot;
It&#39;s okay. There are still people in our school who steal Qingqing. The husband and wife are together, and the mistress is also a colleague.
Although he is a scumbag, your being timid once or twice will only make him worse, thinking that you are a soft persimmon that can be easily manipulated, recording directly, or asking questions loudly in public.
Yibo, when you see him out of the corner of your eye, turn on the recording. If he makes such remarks to you again, just ask, &quot;Teacher xx, are you talking about me?&quot; and save the evidence. Either wrong yourself or give yourself some excuse.
Scold him. . . . . He can do anything to you. We grown women must never give in. Don&#39;t be afraid. If you tear him apart, he can&#39;t quit you. Besides, he is a habitual offender. If you go crazy, everyone will definitely support you. What are you afraid of? !
Fighting violence with violence, do you think people of your age can be tough?
Recordings are not fully recognized by law, remember to record them in the future
Yes, that thing of yours looks empty. If you can’t use it anymore, go to a hospital and have it cut. It’s not easy to have a lump every day at your age. Please pay more attention to yourself.
Aren’t teachers’ ethics and ethics very strict nowadays? Leave evidence to report.
Look at his crotch
If there is anything you can&#39;t fight, record it and then go to the principal. If it doesn&#39;t work out, go to the reporter. What can I endure?
What are you afraid of? He doesn’t pay your salary.
What&#39;s the point? No matter how bad your family is, don&#39;t be a coward. Just be a thorn in the side.
Why don&#39;t you give him two ears of wax?
Just turn off the lights and throw it at him
//@ Along the Galaxy: Next time you open the recording on the spot and play it in front of him. If he doesn&#39;t say anything, just say: You continue, I&#39;m still waiting for your advice. Many female colleagues don&#39;t pay attention to maintenance. I&#39;ll help you spread the word. Let everyone pay attention
Unbearable
Unappetizing
Avoid him. If you can&#39;t afford to offend him, you can avoid him. If you mess with him too much, you&#39;ll be disgusted. Just avoid him and don&#39;t answer the phone. Don&#39;t even go to dinner. Just turn him down. If you can&#39;t turn him down, you&#39;ll know that you have a softer temperament. and
The next time he is with you, you can turn on the recording in advance or if he says this again, pretend to play with your phone and turn on the recording and ask him, &quot;Brother, what did you say?&quot;
Act like you are surprised and say loudly, you must have bought it for your daughter, wife, mother, or you have bought it for yourself. I really can’t see that Teacher X, you still have this habit. (Smiling) Don’t worry, our young people today can understand, right, Teacher XX (a teacher with status around you) but Teacher XX, I’m kind enough to say a few words, but you can hide it more carefully and don’t let Parents of students know that they must feel that such people are not worthy of being teachers.
Guonan daily operations
fuck it
@dreampatientO_o
Report it
If there is anything you can&#39;t fight, just spread it to him loudly.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh so disgusting
They are all teachers. If you are afraid of being embarrassed, slap him with a big ear, cry to the people around you to get sympathy, ask your old people to spit on him, go to the Education Bureau to cry to the leaders, ask his family members to tear him apart.
From now on, whenever I see him, I&#39;ll start recording
Pat, even if some people are born surrounded by people, everyone can only sleep alone...

What happened
Small flower cards are not suitable for sisters with high cyber ethics. Yura&#39;s CG is relatively wild, the collapse is really collapse, and the magic is also amazing. Nowadays, there are so many B-games that have been ported to Chinese versions. There is a certain reason why Xiaohua Pai is so popular.
3 I also feel that... a lot of the marginal welfare content is given by the female protagonist to the male protagonist. I can&#39;t tell that there are some difficult comments in other chapters for female audiences.
It&#39;s okay. In the fourth part, you will understand what it means to really go to jail.
2 and 3 are true... The heroine who is in a higher position in the relationship will be very unbearable, and the feeling of being rebellious is very painful... I can accept the xsr plot, but please make the heroine a carnivorous person, and it will be very uncomfortable to be given everything unilaterally. accurate…
Although there are so many shortcomings, the plot of the third part is really good and can stand up to scrutiny, comparable to an 8/10 anime.
In fact, there is pure love, Tang Hong chapter: utt line
I love every CG of Yura&#39;s paintings when I see the airwaves in Yura&#39;s style. It&#39;s very to my liking.
It is true or not that the Jiao line collapses. I always think that the Ji line collapses more ()
I&#39;m just playing butter, I&#39;ll be done with it if I like it
Not to mention anything else, I feel like everyone’s hair volume is quite worrying szd
There are tens of thousands of games, so just change it if it doesn’t suit you~ It’s just a good time to take advantage of the current popularity and the physical version of Jiao Chapter is out of stock.
Are you playing such a big game?
So I only like utt
It’s such a short four-part series that was all supported by playing cards. Who can bear the thought of having to re-level four times?
So I’m really struggling whether I should buy this game or not. I only like utt but he’s in the same chapter as Tang Hong... When we played the demo, Tang Hong attacked his chest in public as soon as he started, which made my impression of him drop to the lowest level.
The female rivalry is weakened in every part, until the end, everyone basically loves the heroine (only for the first three chapters)
I’ve already pulled the plug on the author’s description of Xiong Jing and the borderline plot. Thank you for clearing it up.
It is true that both the heart and the body are hurt,
The reason why this evil person only got utt×mkt in Xiaohuatai
The length is really short. I feel like a large part of my time comes from playing cards.
This blogger is awesome
It’s very annoying that it appears on my homepage every day
It is indeed a good move, but in fact, I personally think that we should educate those species that think with their lower bodies to control their own thoughts (not purely personal opinion)

How could there be such a stupid teacher?
You should tell him that I am in a bad mood and can I slap you?
It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s just abnormal and disgusting, and it escaped quickly
Lugu?
It feels much more comfortable to send it out 😌
I don’t rule out another interpretation. What do you think?
Those who assault and harass women must be severely punished
Women&#39;s rights should be protected.
It&#39;s so disgusting. It needs to be investigated strictly.
It&#39;s really disrespectful and outrageous. Report him.
Customer service should be respectful, this behavior is so rude
Women’s dignity needs to be protected and respected
The business is obviously irresponsible. Women must be respected.
Customer service like this must be dealt with seriously
I hope merchants can pay attention to this matter and protect the rights and interests of consumers.
System negligence is understandable, but attitude must not be tolerated!
Women’s rights should be protected and any form of sexual harassment should not be tolerated
Women’s dignity needs to be protected and respected! ♀
It seems that the merchant doesn&#39;t care about the customer&#39;s size at all. It&#39;s so irresponsible.
As female consumers, we need more respect and protection
Women’s privacy has been violated and must be dealt with seriously!
Customer service should provide professional help, not sexism and inappropriate requests
The customer service is absolutely terrible, I hope no one ever experiences harassment like this again
This kind of sexual harassment should be severely punished!
Customer service should respect consumers and not treat women like this! ♀
It’s so sad that this happened to the lady.
Girls’ privacy should be respected! ♀
Great, 666, like it
The merchant is obviously irresponsible, the customer service is overly verbal, and women must be respected.
I hope businesses can value and respect customers’ privacy rights!
Now, to sum it up in one sentence, the little bourgeoisie have no idea what a communist fighter is. Don&#39;t jump to gender at every turn. Using gender is just to confuse things.
&quot;I was born to be a mountain&quot; and &quot;I am originally a mountain&quot; may seem the same, but in fact they have very different meanings. One is self-confident and self-improvement, the other is self-pity. The cultural level of the director of this film is really not good.
She also said, &quot;Your grandma and I are Gaoshan.&quot; That&#39;s awesome.
I’m really angry that Principal Zhang Guimei is used as a selling point for them to make money.
This incident also contributed another golden sentence, &quot;The righteous Six Princesses will never agree.&quot; Together with this &quot;Gao Shan&quot;, it will definitely be recorded in the history of domestic entertainment.
To call them mediocre is a bit flattering to them. They&#39;re stupid and arrogant.
It would be terrible if deconstruction was used by someone with ulterior motives... By dissolving the original meaning of everyday words, strange thoughts can penetrate subtly... Even if you have been brainwashed for many years, you don&#39;t even know it.
Comrade is such a beautiful word. Like-minded people are the portrayal of countless revolutionary martyrs. But today it is used to describe a minority group in society, and this group is also extremely chaotic and decadent.
At that time, I felt uncomfortable when the screenwriter said this sentence, because he was no longer pretending. &quot;The suffering and fatigue are all Jiao Yulu&#39;s fault, and all the benefits are obtained by a stupid boy like me.&quot; They will never understand what Teacher Li Xuejian said. If you want to covet the merits of God and seek benefit for yourself, you will be punished!
The screenwriter insulted this sentence
Ah...tmd!
As a screenwriter, a person who makes a living by writing, she should be very lucky to have the honor to write such a living and admirable person. She should be in awe and calm and steady in her heart. Even if she receives negative comments, she should be rational. Be open to comments. I didn’t expect that a person with a pen would actually say something like “Your grandma is the mountain” under such circumstances. It’s really staggering!
Your awareness is so incredible
How did this crew survive until now?
Language cannot withstand deconstruction
I am reminded of Calvino&#39;s words: I have no confidence in anything that is easy to come by, fast, instinctive, impromptu, or vague. I believe in the power of slow, peaceful, steady flow, solidity, and calmness. The director and screenwriter tried to spend 130 minutes to &quot;create&quot; a character named Zhang Guimei. The mountain is right there, but those who stand on the top of the mountain and look out think they have conquered the mountain.
Mediocre literary and artistic creators, please stay away from famous works and celebrities, and keep a heart of awe.
Still a dead duck with a tough mouth
Bloggers are so good at saying that they not only have no talent, but also no morals. In essence, they just want to gain fame and fortune through Mr. Zhang’s filmmaking and winning awards.
What he said was very agreeable and deeply insightful. . .
Some memes are vulgar and are meant to create traffic, but don’t harm the Chinese language.
A pure bitch
Saying such things will only make people think that they are lowly cowards who should be despised.
Very accurate understanding and explanation
You can speak more!
@叶__青hahahaha
Deconstruction is often intentional
Words can present completely different emotions in different contexts. If you just read this passage alone, what comes to your mind is high-spirited and high-spirited. And when this text appears in the current incident, what the audience thinks of is probably hysterical incompetent rage. Of course, some people will also imagine the unyielding struggle of human beings to wake up. It all depends on the author and readers&#39; understanding of the event. But it would be too low to play with political correctness.
Maybe he didn&#39;t understand at all
Even if the screenwriter was in a superior state, it was so unexpected that he could say something like &quot;I am a mountain&quot;. I didn&#39;t even feel angry. I just thought the whole thing was too humorous.
Let’s deconstruct it together. It turns out that public intellectuals are still public intellectuals.
A great person should not be consumed by that group of people
Can you be down-to-earth and come among the masses to see and listen more?
The screenwriter&#39;s response was really shallow and arrogant.
That&#39;s right, he&#39;s aloof
I was looking forward to it, but now I don’t want to go see it at all
Agree so much
So shameless
That&#39;s really good to say
Too good to say
Sounds like what a little girl would say
Hey, the scary thing is that mediocre art creators never believe that they are mediocre.
This screenwriter is so impassioned that it makes people pee. . .
They are not worth asking for...
A despicable heart cannot understand noble aspirations and can only speculate and conceive of a third-way motive, which is euphemistically called endowing humanity.
please!
Some people don’t have a double weight if they don’t get a good name. But if they get a good name, they find that they are as light as a feather.
Born as a mountain, it will always be a mountain. It was originally a mountain, but what about now?
The powerful class: I was born to be powerful//@七奇奇Z: “I was born into a mountain” and “I am originally a mountain” may seem the same, but in fact they have very different meanings. One is self-confident and self-improvement, and the other is self-pity. The cultural level of the director of this film is really not good.
&quot;High mountain&quot; will soon become a symbol. This symbol will be completely separated from the meaning contained in the original discourse. It will be distorted and alienated in the Internet scolding war, and eventually become a satirical concept. It’s almost like the weird “Ah, yes, yes, you are a mountain, your whole family is a mountain, and I am the gravel pressed down by the mountain”
How could he have the nerve to tell me that I am from a high mountain? Where is his high mountain? May I ask?
Don&#39;t harm the mountains
It sounds like something only an illiterate person would say, but it turns out she is a screenwriter
This screenwriter seems a bit pretentious when he says that.
TM is a word that insults women.
He has already used insulting words, so let him go
Isn&#39;t this &quot;stigmatization of Chinese characters&quot;?
You cannot understand communism and you can only find character motivations based on personal emotions. You don’t understand the masses, you don’t understand the party, and you don’t understand what feminism is.
It’s ridiculous, and it’s also a criticism of the vast majority of netizens
Well, you can say that, people are not good
The screenwriter is full of arrogance and ridicules the audience, and does not reflect the spiritual core of socialism at all.
The curse words in &quot;I am a mountain&quot; are all about women, and they have the feeling of being incompetent and furious.
//@伊BLUEJIZIZI’s leg hair: The screenwriter at that time really looked like a hopeless illiterate//@Chiyue ENID: She also said, “Your grandma, I am a high mountain” is really awesome
And you use insulting words for women?
Such people are the brilliance of human nature and the embodiment of ideals and beliefs. You can be as small as dust, but you cannot be twisted like maggots. Some people are not small, but they are more twisted than maggots. Those dark and twisted people have no interest in brilliance and ideals. Hatred is a true reflection of their inner fear and inferiority
The title of this movie is not as good as Girls&#39; School in the Mountains. Although it is a very common title, it fits Teacher Zhang very well.
This is the purpose of making this movie and naming it after it
A ravine is shouting that it is a mountain, and even God finds it funny
So what does Qiaolezi mean?
No wonder they like Tonya, she is just as superficial as she is
&quot;I was born to be a mountain.&quot; A short sentence can make people feel the spiritual power of perseverance, perseverance and self-improvement. &quot;I am a mountain&quot;? ? ? What the hell is this? It’s so vulgar.
Mediocre literary and artistic creators, stay away from famous works and celebrities, and maintain a heart of awe. This is your greatest contribution to the world, please!
Take away your heroes, insult your beliefs, and deconstruct your writings.
When I saw the title of this movie for the first time, I always understood that the mountain was not only the mountain that the girls climbed over with difficulty, but also the principal Zhang Guimei who firmly supported the girls&#39; hopes like a mountain. Now when I read this screenwriter, I said, &quot; &quot;I am a mountain&quot;, the screenwriter is a &quot;mountain&quot;, which is a stumbling block for China&#39;s film industry
After reading some of the comments from other netizens, screenwriter, are you okay? The students have a big problem. They are just like those people in the city who don&#39;t like to go to school. The problem is that the background of the movie is mountains.
The most incomprehensible thing is the sentence &quot;Your grandma and I are the mountains.&quot;
They are only suitable for writing odes to joy
The film&#39;s creators vividly explained what &quot;streams&quot;, &quot;mediocre ravines&quot;, &quot;weeds&quot; and &quot;humble cowards&quot; are.
To make a digression, it is not to keep mediocre creators away, but to keep society vigilant and critical at the same time. I don’t know what mediocrity is before I create it, but after I have the mental shackles of “mediocre” on it, there may be nothing left.
That is nice
When Yuzuru Hanyu attempted 4A figure skating in the Winter Olympics, the Chinese commentator used this passage and was said to be inappropriate. As for the screenwriter, it’s hard to comment.
At first, literary and art workers chose literature and art because they loved literature and art. Now, literary and art workers do not have enough points in science subjects and are forced to choose literature and art.
It’s nothing, anyway, screenwriters, actors, reporters, these things are becoming like stinky old nine.
Yes, deconstruction is a form of boiling the frog in blasphemy
@桃小元子 who loves to eat steamed fish laughs to death
The Gaoshan mentioned by the screenwriter refers to a class that is superior to others in terms of status, not a great person who is superior to others in terms of realm and structure. Bah, what the hell is she?
Level
They do it on purpose. They cannot create beauty and greatness by themselves, but they are jealous beyond recognition and use whatever means necessary.
The county party committee mobilized donations to treat Principal Zhang&#39;s illness. She always said it was repayment, but why in the movie did she have to resist and couldn&#39;t be filmed?
Don’t feel structured. How can such arrogance and rudeness as &quot;Your grandma and I were born in the mountains&quot; be compared with the original passionate words and aspirations?
The screenwriter said this like an old virgin lusting after his unrivaled charm that makes people want to stop.
Being condescending and self-righteous, the entertainment industry is really hopeless
Teacher Zhang&#39;s &quot;I am a mountain&quot; means that I have lofty beliefs, strive to have a great character, have a long-term and ambitious vision, do not be a coward, serve the people, and strive to make the motherland strong. I, the main creator, am a high mountain, which means that I am a high mountain and what I say is righteous. Shut up. We, the high mountains, can only look down at you, the small ones.
She is the dark ravine, full of mud and maggots
She doesn’t understand the persistence of carp leaping over the farm gate
The bandits can go, and so can I. We can not deconstruct, but we cannot not deconstruct.
&quot;You are a ditch&quot;
It’s 2023, and you can actually see the self-proclaimed “six princesses” of feudal society typed out from the official blog content, and it’s still at the end, what are you trying to emphasize?
Those speculators who try to cheat and tarnish great communist fighters like Principal Zhang Guimei who are pure, noble, free from vulgar tastes, and who are beneficial to the country and the people will not end well.
Ah ah ah ah ah thank you baby Nanchang little girl is ecstatic
I&#39;m laughing so hard. Is that Zhen across from me?

I&#39;ll give you a plane ticket, but I won&#39;t give it to you if you walk slowly.
These two are so funny together. . Two straight men. . . .
Speaking of which, this should be Che&#39;s attempt to turn the plot towards Qiyan, but it obviously failed miserably!
What&#39;s wrong
Being called baby by a 160 greasy man is one of the things I least want to remember in high school.
If the full-time ra quits and I continue to be a part-time ra, I will be really, really disgusted to death.
Don&#39;t make excuses to attract perverts
There&#39;s nothing wrong. If you think it&#39;s wrong, you have a problem. Other ways to say it are &quot;pass it&quot;, &quot;borrow it&quot;, etc.
Please give way
Enter at will, as long as you exert your strength
I want to sue my mother
Get out of the way!
In Mandarin, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to borrow it.&quot; In Shanghainese, &quot;Fashiao stood up and opened the door to Xingxi.&quot;
Get started (irritable)
