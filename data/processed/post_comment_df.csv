CCTV speaks out for stray cats and dogs, and the views of legal experts are even more surprising: one dog is wrong, and thousands of dogs and cats pay the bill. After the Rottweiler incident in Chongzhou, Chengdu, too many innocent stray animals have died on the streets. Some of them were injured by residents in the community, and some were killed by security guards for the safety of residents. In short, their deaths should not have been such an accident. As time passed, we finally waited for CCTV’s announcement! This time, CCTV also spoke for stray cats and dogs! Is it the human&#39;s fault or the dog&#39;s? Looking back at the original Rottweiler biting incident, you will find that if you want to prevent the incident from happening, you only need one key person, which is the dog&#39;s owner. If the offending dog is led by a leash when going out, it is supervised by its owner. , presumably it cannot hurt the child no matter what. Unfortunately, the dog was not leashed and the owner did not surrender until early in the morning, so it was too late. The first responsible party in this matter is the dog, but the specific responsible person behind this responsible party is the owner of the dog. It is precisely for this reason that after the incident happened, the girl’s family will hold the other party responsible, and the dog owner will also Forced to surrender. Why shouldn’t people pay for their faults? CCTV’s views have also been supported by many experts and scholars. A law professor at a university even bluntly said that protecting animals is actually protecting people. A law professor is obviously an expert in his professional field. Why does he have such surprising views? I think maybe it&#39;s because this professor understands the essence of the matter. Many times, people deal with cats and dogs vigorously and resolutely, not because they are speaking out for justice, but to satisfy their own inner desires. People use this behavior to vent their emotions, thinking that stray animals will not speak for themselves, and we do not need to pay a price or bear any responsibility for any of our actions. But if such atrocities continue unchecked, then when one day those who harm animals are no longer satisfied with harming animals, where will they turn their attention? I think it is precisely with this in mind that law professors come up with the idea that protecting animals means protecting people. A professor at Tsinghua University also pointed out that human behavior is the main cause of stray dogs. This point of view summarizes many facts, which are actually deliberately ignored by some people. Some people treat cats and dogs as pets. They buy them with money and throw them away when they don&#39;t like them. There are more and more stray animals in the city, but why don&#39;t we think about why there are so many stray animals in the city? What did these stray animals go through before they became stray animals? Some netizens mentioned the disposal of animals abroad. Every pet owner has a responsibility for his or her pet. If a pet is abandoned, the pet owner must bear the responsibility. This responsibility is specific and will make them Don’t dare abandon your pets easily. With punishment, there will be fewer and fewer abandoned animals, and the number of stray animals will not be able to grow so fast. In the final analysis, solving the root cause of stray animals is not about dealing with the animals, but to prevent such behavior from happening again. This is reasonable and controllable. This time, CCTV has spoken out, as have university professors, experts and scholars. I wonder if these wise and rational remarks can make people who are trapped in emotions completely wake up and seriously think about the nature of this issue?

This has to be said about Germany. The Germans&#39; regulations on raising dogs are really strict and are engraved in the hearts of Germans. Let China copy it, there is indeed something worth learning from capitalism. Here’s a summary of some of the rules for raising dogs in Germany: 1. Keeping a dog requires the consent of your neighbors. When raising a dog in Germany, you must first obtain the consent of your neighbors and ensure that it will not affect their lives. You can&#39;t let your dog urinate randomly, and you can&#39;t let your dog bark at home and disturb your neighbors&#39; rest. If you violate these regulations, you may be subject to fines or other penalties. 2. Dog owners and dogs must go to dog school. It costs 50 euros per hour to raise a dog in Germany. After your neighbor agrees, you have to take your puppy to dog school, from kindergarten to junior high school, and then the high school graduation exam. You and you Only when dogs get their diplomas can they enter society. 3. You have to pay tax for raising a dog. You have to pay it every year. Taking Berlin as an example, you need to pay 120 euros in tax every year to raise the first dog, and you have to pay another 180 euros to raise the second dog. If you keep a dog secretly without paying taxes, If found, a fine of 10,000 euros will be imposed. 4. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs with a compensation of no less than 1 million euros. Under normal circumstances, German dog owners need to pay an annual insurance premium of 75 to 270 euros for their dogs, and dangerous dogs have to pay more than 30% more premiums. 5. Dog owners must spend enough time with their dogs. When raising a dog in Germany, dog owners need to spend a certain amount of time with their dogs. For example, owners should take their dogs with them when they go out, and they cannot leave their dogs at home alone for more than 3 hours. If you do not walk your dog for a long time, someone will complain to an animal protection organization. The charge is that you torture small animals. 6. Dog owners are fined 90,000 euros for abandoning dogs. German law stipulates that anyone who abandons a dog (including those who move and leaves the dog in the same place) must be fined 90,000 euros and may be imprisoned for 3 years. 7. A chip must be implanted and you must pay for it at your own expense. According to the European Union, all pets (cats, dogs, and minks) must have an ID number. There are two options: one is to tattoo the number on a conspicuous part of the pet&#39;s skin; the other is to implant it under the skin. Enter the microchip. 8. Adoption costs money. In Germany, adoption is not free. For example, in Berlin, the cost of adopting a dog is generally 205 euros. 9. Documents are required. The pet’s identity certificate and health certificate are essential! 10. Dogs are not allowed to enter some public places. Dogs are strictly prohibited from entering children&#39;s playgrounds, leisure lawns, swimming pools and other places marked &quot;Dogs are not allowed&quot;. Anyone who fails to supervise dogs in public places will be fined 10,000 euros. 11. Feeding stray dogs is deemed as having custody. If a stray dog bites someone, the person who feeds it will be responsible for compensation. 12. Stray dogs that are not adopted are killed. In Germany, stray dogs captured by the government are killed if no one pays to adopt them within ten days. Therefore, there are no stray dogs on the streets in Germany now...",282,-0.146187922126562,5,8,277,100.0,0,1,1492.0,10000.0,1,0,1.0,94.6851,2.0,18.0,-1.0172,1.0,0.0,8,25,4

I don’t like dogs myself. When I was a child, I was chased by a stray dog on the way to school, which has left a shadow on me for the rest of my life. , it is impossible to live with a dog in this life. But many of my relatives and friends have cats and dogs, and under their control I can live in peace with dogs. So although I can’t raise a dog myself, I can understand and respect it. But unmanaged dogs should be taken into custody. Dogs are always animals. It’s not surprising that they bite people. They bite people anyway. If they get out of human control, they are a huge hidden danger. Urban stray dogs are not abandoned by irresponsible people who like dogs for two days. You should not scold the people who take them in. You should scold the people who abandon them. They make the dogs homeless and out of control. Stray dogs controlled by people should be taken into custody. So I said, agree to this and let’s talk about the method. Those who come up and say &quot;dogs are higher than people&quot; and &quot;people are inferior to dogs&quot;, stay away from them. It is always people-oriented. The risk of dog bites should not be passed on to the public. This has a mass basis. The holders of this risk are only the silent majority. I still hope that the government can assume this responsibility, because if If the government transfers this power and responsibility and ignores risks but they still exist, then whoever bears the risks will take action. For example, the ham sausage incident is not only illegal, but also creates other risks. Another example is using weapons for self-defense. If everyone brings weapons when going out, social instability will suddenly increase. Therefore, the government will not leave stray dogs alone. Instead of worrying about stray dogs being caught, it is better to promote the standardized management of dog owners from the source, and introduce regulatory measures for abandoned dogs, those who are not on leashes, those who are not certified, those who are not vaccinated, those who bite people, and those who bite dogs. And punitive measures, like traffic regulations, a point deduction and fine system, compensation for those who deserve it, and penalties for those who deserve it. After the points are deducted, it is forbidden to apply for a dog license within a few years. If you keep a dog without a license, you will be fully responsible. If you bite someone because you have not been vaccinated against rabies, you will be responsible. If a person dies, he will be punished like a drunk driver. This is called standardizing dog raising. Rules without penalties are invalid. Those who cannot do it cannot raise dogs. Since stray dogs originate from dog owners, regulating dog ownership in this way can reduce stray dogs from the source.

So, how to control the problem of stray dogs? This has to be said about Germany. The Germans&#39; regulations on raising dogs are really strict and are engraved in the hearts of Germans. Let China copy it, there is indeed something worth learning from capitalism. Here’s a summary of some of the rules for raising dogs in Germany: 1. Keeping a dog requires the consent of your neighbors. When raising a dog in Germany, you must first obtain the consent of your neighbors and ensure that it will not affect their lives. You can&#39;t let your dog urinate randomly, and you can&#39;t let your dog bark at home and disturb your neighbors&#39; rest. If you violate these regulations, you may be subject to fines or other penalties. 2. Dog owners and dogs must go to dog school. It costs 50 euros per hour to raise a dog in Germany. After your neighbor agrees, you have to take your puppy to dog school, from kindergarten to junior high school, and then the high school graduation exam. You and you Only when dogs get their diplomas can they enter society. 3. You have to pay tax for raising a dog. You have to pay it every year. Taking Berlin as an example, you need to pay 120 euros in tax every year to raise the first dog, and you have to pay another 180 euros to raise the second dog. If you keep a dog secretly without paying taxes, If found, a fine of 10,000 euros will be imposed. 4. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs with a compensation of no less than 1 million euros. Under normal circumstances, German dog owners need to pay an annual insurance premium of 75 to 270 euros for their dogs, and dangerous dogs have to pay more than 30% more premiums. 5. Dog owners must spend enough time with their dogs. When raising a dog in Germany, dog owners need to spend a certain amount of time with their dogs. For example, owners should take their dogs with them when they go out, and they cannot let their dogs stay alone for more than 3 hours. If you do not walk your dog for a long time, someone will complain to an animal protection organization. The charge is that you torture small animals. 6. Dog owners are fined 90,000 euros for abandoning dogs. German law stipulates that anyone who abandons a dog (including those who move and leaves the dog in the same place) must be fined 90,000 euros and may be imprisoned for 3 years. 7. The chip must be implanted at your own expense. The European Union stipulates that all pets (cats, dogs, and minks) must have ID numbers. There are two forms available: one is to tattoo the number on a conspicuous part of the pet&#39;s skin; the other is to implant it under the skin. Enter the microchip. 8. Adoption costs money. In Germany, adoption is not free. For example, in Berlin, the cost of adopting a dog is generally 205 euros. 9. Documents are required. The pet’s identity certificate and health certificate are essential! 10. Dogs are not allowed to enter some public places. Dogs are strictly prohibited from entering children&#39;s playgrounds, leisure lawns, swimming pools and other places marked &quot;Dogs are not allowed&quot;. Those who fail to supervise dogs in public places will be fined 10,000 euros. 11. Feeding stray dogs is deemed as having custody. If a stray dog bites someone, the person feeding it will be responsible for compensation. 12. Stray dogs that are not adopted are killed. In Germany, stray dogs captured by the government are killed if no one pays to adopt them within ten days. Therefore, there are no stray dogs on the streets in Germany now...",282,-0.1449918828101822,5,8,278,100.0,0,80,435.7625,10000.0,26,23,0.75,74.7225,3.5556,13.9,-0.2932,0.3375,0.825,8,25,4

Stray dogs are indeed not suitable for living in densely populated cities. How about adopting them as soon as possible? If they cannot be adopted, they can only be rendered harmless, or dog lovers can donate money and help to build shelters. If you love dogs, you have to raise dogs that no one wants. Otherwise, what is it called loving dogs? The more pitiful the dog, the more it should be adopted. Breeding new puppies is completely unnecessary.

As a dog owner, why would a dog with such killing ability be let loose? 3. Rottweiler is an exotic breed and not a native breed. Who is behind the breeding and selling of these breeds that are neither native nor suitable for urban breeding? I have seen people talking about adoption in many places. I must say this.

Usually when no one is around, they will let him run around in an open and uninhabited place within sight of others, to have fun or something. There is an old man in the same city who takes his two greyhounds for a walk. He keeps saying that his dogs are like those dogs from abroad that can kill anything.

Seeing the two groups of people on the Internet holding different opinions and arguing endlessly, I am really afraid to discuss this matter on a public platform. I am timid and cowardly, and I am afraid of being misunderstood and being criticized, but as someone who has had two extreme attitudes towards dogs, I still want to share my opinion. Before graduating at the age of 23, I had a very negative attitude towards dogs. When I was a child, I was bitten two or three times for no apparent reason, and I had to take a detour when I saw a puppy. What I remember very clearly is that my dad’s classmate from his hometown had a very big dog, and if he wanted to go to the toilet, he had to go through it. In the woodshed where the dog lived, I would rather let my mother take me to the toilet next door than to pass by the &quot;demon&quot; in my eyes. After graduating at the age of 23, I often spend my free time after get off work watching cute dog pictures and videos to heal my tired soul. In November of my first year on the job, my passion for raising a dog reached its peak. After dinner every night, I would search around the rental house, trying to &quot;pick up dogs&quot;; for a while, I would often buy ham sausages at a convenience store and feed them to the stray dogs around Zhabei Park. I really wanted to have my own dog, so after doing a lot of homework, I took a car with my friend for more than an hour after work on a Friday to adopt a stray dog from a pet shop near Gucun Park. From that time on, my love for dogs evolved from simply thinking they were cute, to treating them as my own relatives from the bottom of my heart. Raising a dog is not a casual job. You have to walk it every morning and evening, and you have to be ready to pick up poop with your hands when walking. Dogs are not always obedient. Sometimes they will not listen to your orders and run rampant, stealing food, and taking advantage of others. Make trouble when you&#39;re not home. These are all the preparations you need to make before raising a dog. You cannot just want it to be cute without wanting to be responsible for it. The lifespan of a dog is about 15 years. If you raise a dog, you must keep it as long as possible and accompany them until life. The end. But what is hateful is that many people keep dogs on a whim, causing countless tragedies involving stray dogs. So are stray dogs wrong? It’s the irresponsible dog owners who are at fault. After seeing the news, I repeatedly emphasized to my parents in the group that when I go out for a walk, I must keep a leash and even wear a muzzle. This is to protect the dogs and is also responsible for them. Because the family in your eyes may also be the devil in the eyes of others. Only by comparing each other&#39;s hearts can we reach a consensus. In addition, I have to reflect on myself. I am the kind of person who has no sense of boundaries when it comes to dogs. Sometimes when I see a cute dog on the road, I want to go up and ask the owner if I can pet it. This must be changed. It&#39;s normal to love dogs, but you have to be clear in your heart that every dog has different habits. If the owner says it doesn&#39;t bite, it&#39;s just for the owner and acquaintances. For you, a stranger, you may irritate it if you are not careful. Isn’t the news about a woman with her child being bitten by a dog on the street with her face covered in blood enough to scare you? Regulate your own behavior. If you have a dog, raise it seriously and responsibly. Treat it like a family member. Keep it on a leash and wear a muzzle when going out. Give way to people who are afraid of dogs when you encounter them in public places. Be more understanding towards others. Only by being yourself can you shut others up.

At around 22:30 on October 17, 2023, a student at Chongqing University of International Business and Economics was chased by a stray dog on his way home. After the school security discovered it, considering campus safety, the security guard The stray dog was driven away and died during the driving process. After investigation, the security personnel did engage in improper behavior in the process of driving away and dealing with stray dogs. The school has currently suspended the security guards involved. (China News Network) A two-year-old girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu, was bitten by a vicious dog. The tragic incident touched people&#39;s hearts and triggered the anger of the whole society against uncivilized dog breeding. Actions were launched to combat uncivilized dog breeding and stray dogs in various places. Among them, short video platforms On the Internet, the frequent killings of stray dogs, represented by Chongqing University of International Business and Economics, triggered heated discussions among netizens, and the public opinion field began to divide. Some netizens supported this behavior and believed that it was indeed conducive to protecting public safety, but most netizens were We express our opposition and condemnation, and are deeply saddened by this. Dogs are the most common animals in the world. They are not born with a standard owner. Nature and wind, snow, rain and moon are their habitat. The word wandering itself should not be given to them. The place where they live is Their territory, whether it is streets, trash cans or flower beds, we all live in the same earth home. Why not solve the problem fundamentally, introduce relevant laws and regulations, raise pets in a civilized manner, raise pets in accordance with the law, and use systems to manage and restrict them. And we have to choose this extreme method to kill all the dogs with one rod. There are bad people and good people. In the same way, there are bad dogs and good dogs. They are also living lives like us, with red color. Blood has breathing and temperature. Do you think the search and rescue dogs of the Wenchuan earthquake, the drug detection dogs at the border, and the guide dogs for the blind are less great than humans? We cannot exclude others based on generalizations in order to protect ourselves. As human beings, we should distinguish between good and bad, protect the weak, and find better solutions. This is what we should do. The root cause of the stray dog disaster lies in people&#39;s indiscriminate behavior, and the corresponding social rescue capabilities and management levels are insufficient. For the many stray dogs that cannot find a home, it is far better to introduce relevant policies to encourage social welfare than to use manpower and material resources to hunt and kill them on the streets. The organization participates in the rescue and encourages caring families to adopt them. For example, on October 18, the Linfen Small Animal Protection Association issued a document saying that the Linfen Urban Management Bureau sent all stray dogs to the base, where they can be treated kindly by caring people and their lives are respected, and encouraged the public to adopt them. In order to fundamentally curb the social problems caused by stray dogs, we should improve the registration and daily management of residents’ dog ownership from the source, improve relevant laws and regulations, increase penalties for those who abandon pets for no reason, and punish those who cause personal injury. Vicious incidents will be severely punished in accordance with the law. In short, it is a vicious dog that bites people. The root cause of the tragedy lies in the negligence of irresponsible dog owners. Innocent stray dogs should not be affected. All things in the world are equal. Humans should not kill innocent people indiscriminately. All living beings have the right to be treated. Respect, you don’t have to love but please don’t hurt. What stray dogs need is love and care, and they should receive reasonable protection. News commentsStray dogs put away d",324,-0.0015029481300233,20,16,293,100.0,0,18,152.33333333333334,7.344522584006229e+22,10,5,0.5,92.3162,19.0,8.722222222222221,3.177,0.2222,0.8333,8,26,4

Various new chain reactions caused by this incident have been seen on the Internet: there are mothers who carry hammers when walking their babies for self-defense, and mothers who walk with leashes. Some carry sticks to intimidate dogs to clear the way, some poison puppies under bushes, some use syringes to poison dog and cat food, some campus security guards beat stray dogs to death, and some capture and lock up dogs in cages to guard factory areas. , some imprison large dogs that are not on the list of prohibited dogs, etc. People&#39;s focus on solving problems has gradually become extreme and antagonistic. Overcorrecting will inevitably create new conflicts and incidents. But shouldn’t the essence of the problem be the uncivilized dog-raising behavior and the corresponding groups of people? Why not solve the problem instead of creating it to ferment conflicts and deviate from the essence of the problem? As a dog owner, I support strict education or crackdowns on those who keep dogs in an uncivilized manner. Sometimes we hate those who keep dogs in an uncivilized manner even more than those who hate dogs or are afraid of dogs. But will killing stray dogs on a large scale solve the problem? Does the large-scale imprisonment of large dogs that are not on the prohibited dog list solve the problem? I can still see that in this moment of turmoil, there are still people who rely on the small size of their dogs and the fact that their dogs are not prohibited dogs and they walk without leashes. The reason is that the current handling methods are not based on the nature of this incident. The essence of the problem is people! Those who don&#39;t obey the law! Uncivilized dog owners! But the dog somehow took on everything. The problem of stray dogs itself is a persistent social problem. This incident caused a sensation and a lot of efforts were made to deal with it, but next spring there will be a new batch of stray dogs. The reason is not a human problem! Some people regard raising a dog as a responsibility, educating them from an early age, raising a dog in a civilized manner, and being responsible for the dog; some people regard raising a dog as a kind of fun, and want to throw it away as soon as the novelty wears off or makes people angry. The most important and core way to solve the problem of stray dogs is to put those irresponsible dog owners on the list for rectification. I was walking the dogs this morning, and a child in the distance said to his mother, &quot;There are two dogs.&quot; His expression and tone were pure and happy. Dogs and children are not antagonistic. As parents of children and dog owners, we should educate children and dogs reasonably and provide each other with a safe, harmonious and friendly environment. Dog owners should walk their dogs on leashes, actively intervene and stop certain behaviors of their puppies, and actively avoid children or younger children without guardians present. Parents of children should also guide their children. Although puppies are cute, unfamiliar dogs can be looked at from a distance but should not be too close and do not touch them directly. Parents are not supported in simply instilling in their children the idea that &quot;all dogs bite.&quot; At the same time, we should also stop children from barking, screaming, stamping, and hitting dogs. In short, such a safe, harmonious and friendly environment requires everyone to work together to create, maintain and educate with heart and patience. I hope that children will smile happily when they see cute puppies, and that the puppies can grow up happily under the care of responsible owners.

They never take the initiative to approach humans. There were even times when I wanted to play with them. No one paid any attention to me. How many of those who were bitten did it because they took the initiative and made the dog feel dangerous before they fought back? We shouldn&#39;t kill all stray dogs cruelly. I also want to ask a question, why are there stray dogs? Why are there so many? Because of human abandonment. It is not a choice for puppies to be strays or not. Because of human selfishness, they let them wander and let their children continue to wander. Now, because these stray dogs have harmed humans, we have to selfishly hunt them down. Look at how ridiculous this is. Writing this reminds me of some memories. I used to have a dog, and she was a very well-behaved and domineering little sister. She never harmed anyone on her own initiative. At that time, I really hated having children at home, because the children would always provoke the puppy, scratching its fur and tail. The puppy could only hide, and the children would have to follow the dog if they couldn&#39;t catch it. If you chase her, she will definitely resist, but she will only whine twice or pretend to bite as a warning. Whenever this happens, the puppy will always be scolded or even beaten. I was really speechless😒, and even thought viciously, just bite the child to see if he would dare to provoke the dog like this next time, but then I thought, he is just a child and has no judgment of his own about danger. So every time on this occasion, I will look at my dog, not to be afraid that it will bite, but to stop those who are short-sighted from messing with her, because no matter what the outcome, the dog will always be scolded. Since you have a dog, you must be responsible for this life. Walking the dog on a leash or wearing a muzzle is to protect others and the dog. Whether it’s a pet dog biting someone or a stray dog biting someone, in the final analysis, it’s human irresponsibility that causes all this, isn’t it? I think of a saying that adults often say: Ah, he is just a child, what can he understand, you argue with her. It&#39;s quite morally kidnapping, isn&#39;t it?

The world’s attention is focused on this entrepreneurial land with unlimited potential. Venture capital has begun to become a One of the leading forces in the business world. However, far away from the eye of the mobile Internet storm, the Xi&#39;an Institute of Optics and Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an investment institution that proposes hard technology investment concepts was established in Xi&#39;an, focusing on investing and incubating innovative technologies that may change the direction of human civilization. In an investment era where model innovation is the mainstream, the concept of &quot;&quot;investment&quot; was put forward. Today, ten years later, China Science and Technology Star has invested in more than 420 hard technology companies. In this issue, Dr., the founding partner of Zhongke Chuangxing, was invited to talk about his observations and thoughts on hard technology investment in the past ten years. Zhang Lan: You are the proposer and advocate of the concept of hard technology. China Science and Technology Star has also gone through ten years on this road. From the initial proposal of hard technology to now, the waves of technology have risen one after another. Now regarding the eight fields of hard technology, do you think there will be more? Mi Lei: At present, this conclusion has not been particularly challenged, and it is still in the fields proposed at that time. But we use the ideas of physics to condense these eight fields into five major directions, namely matter, energy, information, space, and life. These five major directions constitute an underlying logic, and all other hard technology directions are actually differentiated from these five major directions. Zhang Lan: At the event at the beginning of this year, we mentioned three directions: artificial intelligence, unlimited energy and unlimited life. The five directions you mentioned should be more specific than this summary. So among these five directions, which ones do you focus on and are most optimistic about? Mi Lei: In the information field, we believe that information is from electricity to light, and from electrons to photons. Photon technology will become mainstream in the information field in the future. My point of view is: Just based on the infrastructure of artificial intelligence, the information industry will be an intelligent industry in the future. In the current era of artificial intelligence, photonic technology has become the core of artificial intelligence infrastructure. Recently, TSMC and NVIDIA have begun to use it on GPUs, which has also verified this view. As an important infrastructure for the next industrial revolution, computing power will develop into photon computing and quantum computing in the future, which are key technical fields in the future of the information industry. The energy field, especially the topic of carbon neutrality, has also received a lot of attention. In this regard, superconducting and controllable nuclear fusion technology are considered to be a complete subversion of the energy revolution. If realized, it will promote mankind to enter a Type I civilization and achieve free energy. , free Internet access, and the prospect of free electricity; in the space field, commercial aviation, commercial aerospace, as well as human exploration of Mars and the moon and the establishment of mobile stations are very exciting.

It was so fast! &quot;Altman returns to OpenAI as CEO, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers joins the board of directors&quot; - This reversal occurred under intense pressure from OpenAI&#39;s big investors - employees threatened to resign if Altman&#39;s position was not reinstated. OpenAI will welcome back Sam Altman , and conducted a major reorganization of the board of directors, introducing new directors including Larry Summers. This change has attracted great attention in Silicon Valley and the global AI circle. Altman will return as CEO, and the new board of directors will be chaired by Bret Taylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce.com Inc. and a director of Twitter before being acquired by Elon Musk. Other directors include Summers, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, and current member Adam D&#39;Angelo, co-founder and CEO of Quora Inc. OpenAI released a statement on X (formerly Twitter), saying the company is &quot;discussing specific details.&quot; After Altman was unexpectedly removed, almost all OpenAI employees threatened to resign, and the company decided to reappoint its co-founder. The decision quickly prompted congratulations from key figures at X, including former president Greg Brockman, who said he would also be returning, as did chief technology officer Mira Murati. Altman was fired on Friday over disagreements with the board over the rapid development and commercialization of artificial intelligence. He has been negotiating with the company for reinstatement. Those talks stalled on Sunday as Altman and others pressured existing board members to resign, according to people familiar with the matter. Ultimately, the board appointed a new leader—former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear—and Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s biggest backer, said it would hire Altman to lead a new internal AI team. In just a few hours, the majority of OpenAI&#39;s 770 employees signed a letter to the board of directors saying they might leave to join Microsoft if they didn&#39;t all resign and reinstate Altman. Signatories to the letter include Murati, who was named interim CEO, and OpenAI co-founder and board member Ilya Sutskever, who has differences with Altman over the company&#39;s direction. Sutskever posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday: &quot;I deeply regret participating in the board&#39;s decision. I never meant to harm OpenAI. I love everything we have created together and will do my best to restore unity to the company.&quot; Altman The return caps a tumultuous past few days that have plunged the world&#39;s best-known AI startup into chaos. Summers is a Harvard professor and a staff writer for Bloomberg Television who also serves on the boards of Jack Dorsey&#39;s Block Inc. and Skillsoft Corp. This swift policy reversal may appease investors and reduce the risk of employee exodus en masse. However, it also raises questions about the future path for ChatGPT’s makers and other AI startups. These companies have struggled to find a balance between developing artificial intelligence responsibly while raising huge sums of money from investors to support the expensive computing infrastructure required to build these tools. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and aim to benefit mankind rather than pursue financial gain. The organization later transformed into a profit-cap company and raised billions of dollars from Microsoft and other investors. Although Altman played a major role in these transactions, OpenAI is still governed by a nonprofit board of directors. In recent days, this internal tension has intensified and become the focus of public attention. News of Altman&#39;s removal caught the startup&#39;s investors off guard. Microsoft, one of the major backers that invested more than $10 billion in the startup, was notified only minutes before Altman was fired. The software giant then began working with investors including Thrive Capital and Tiger Global Management to try to bring Altman back. People familiar with the matter said they wished to discuss the private information anonymously. But when that effort failed, Microsoft decided to hire Altman and others from OpenAI. Meanwhile, OpenAI faces a new uncertainty: whether to let employees sell their shares at a valuation of $86 billion. Thrive, which is expected to lead the employee stock tender offer, had not paid as of Saturday and told OpenAI that Altman&#39;s departure would affect its decision-making, people familiar with the matter said. Among all the figures, the 38-year-old Altman has become the spokesperson of artificial intelligence technology in the new era with the success and popularity of ChatGPT. This year, Altman has not only been actively working with regulators within the industry, but has also met regularly with world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. On Thursday, he also participated in an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation panel discussion with other executives and world leaders to discuss the future of AI and its risks. But behind the scenes, conflicts between Altman and board members escalated, particularly with Sutskever. They disagree on how to quickly develop generative AI, how to commercialize the product, and what measures to take to mitigate its potential harm to the public, according to people familiar with the matter. Other board members at the time included D&#39;Angelo, Tasha McCauley, CEO of GeoSimSystems, and Helen Toner, director of strategic and basic research grant programs at Georgetown University&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. Beyond strategic differences, board members also had to contend with Altman&#39;s entrepreneurial ambitions. Altman has been trying to raise billions of dollars from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East to start an AI chip company that would compete with Nvidia Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. In addition, Altman is also negotiating with SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman Masayoshi Son, hoping to obtain billions of dollars in investment to collaborate with former Apple designer Jony Ive to develop AI-oriented hardware. Altman&#39;s side hustles add complexity to his relationship with the board. OpenAI said in a statement on Friday that the board&#39;s internal review found that Altman was not always candid in his communications with the board, which hindered the board from fulfilling its responsibilities. As a result, the board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. The boardroom shakeup is reminiscent of other major events in Silicon Valley history. For example, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was fired in 1985 and returned more than a decade later; Twitter co-founder Dorsey left in 2008 and returned as CEO seven years later.

Altman attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit event in California and discussed art and artists at an event in Oakland. future. According to Brockman&#39;s post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Sutskwe texted Altman that night to ask about arranging a conference call at noon the next day. Brockman said Mulati learned that night that Altman would be fired. At noon on November 17, when Altman was publicly announced to be fired, Altman was in Las Vegas to attend the weekend&#39;s biggest party, the Formula One race. After clicking on the Google Meet link in the hotel room, Suzkowe said that he Will be fired, news will be announced soon. No explanation was given. Brockman said that shortly after noon on the 17th, he received a text message from Sutskwei requesting a call. After receiving the GoogleMeet link four minutes later, Brockman was informed that he would be removed as chairman of the board &quot;but will remain critical to the company and will retain his position as president&quot; and that Altman had been fired. At about the same time, OpenAI published an article on its blog announcing executive changes - Altman was publicly announced as being fired for &quot;consistently being uncandid in his communications with the board of directors and hindering the board of directors from fulfilling its responsibilities.&quot; ability&quot;. Mulati was appointed interim CEO. OpenAI held a general meeting that afternoon, at which Sutskwe defended the board&#39;s decision to oust Altman. He dismissed suggestions that ousting Ultraman amounted to a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; and claimed it was necessary to protect OpenAI&#39;s mission of &quot;making artificial intelligence benefit humanity.&quot; After the meeting, the executive team reconvened in the conference room. An executive told Sutskvi that the lack of detail in the termination announcement was unacceptable and asked other board members to participate in a video call to explain, according to people familiar with the matter. During the call, the executive team pressed the board for about 40 minutes to provide specific examples of Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonor,&quot; which the board refused to do, citing legal reasons. Some executives said they received inquiries from regulators and law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office in Manhattan about Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonesty.&quot; The board agreed to discuss the matter with its attorneys. They came back hours later but still wouldn&#39;t provide specifics. They say Ultraman is not honest and often does whatever he wants. The board said Altman was too well-versed for the board to give specific examples, according to people familiar with the executive. Executives requested written examples of board allegations. Microsoft issued a statement Microsoft&#39;s Nadella, a major investor and partner in OpenAI, issued a statement: &quot;As you will see this week at Microsoft Ignite conference, we will continue to innovate rapidly for this era of AI. We are working across the entire technology stack More than 100 announcements have been made in , including AI systems, models and tools in Azure (Microsoft cloud) and Copilot. Most importantly, we are committed to providing our customers with all of this while building the future. We have signed a contract with OpenAI The long-term agreement provides full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and exciting product roadmap, and will continue to be committed to our partnerships, including Mira and the team. Together, we will continue to bring this The value of this technology brings to the whole world.&quot; Altman called Nadella and expressed his hope to continue studying this technology. They devised various ways to undo the day&#39;s events, but also began working on a backup plan for Altman to have a group of his top researchers create a new unit within the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Brockman Resigns After reading the latest news, Brockman announced his resignation from OpenAI. After he sent a memo internally, he also published the text simultaneously on X. Altman told friends he was considering starting a new company with Brockman and poaching dozens of OpenAI employees. Senior OpenAI researcher resigns Following Brockman, three senior OpenAI researchers resigned, including research director Jakub Pachocki and the Get Ready team, which prepares to deal with the &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; of artificial intelligence. ) head Aleksander Madry. On November 18th, Ultraman was at home. Ultraman flew back to San Francisco immediately after being fired. His home became a war room filled with OpenAI employees, including then-interim CEO Murati and other members of the executive team, plotting his return to the company. Management and board of directors continue to negotiate OpenAI&#39;s internal memo comes to light, saying Altman was fired not because of &quot;malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, security or security/privacy practices,&quot; but because &quot;Sam &quot;There was a breakdown in communication between Altman and the board of directors.&quot; In the memo, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday&#39;s announcement &quot;came as a surprise to (the management team)&quot; and that management &quot;had multiple conversations with the board to try to better understand them.&quot; the reasons and processes behind decisions”. According to the memo, as of the morning of the 18th, discussions were still ongoing. OpenAI&#39;s financing at risk OpenAI&#39;s plan to sell employee shares, which would value the startup at about $86 billion, could be in jeopardy. Three sources at the company revealed that OpenAI no longer expects the deal, led by Thrive Capital, to happen or, if it does, the deal&#39;s valuation will be reduced due to recent developments. Ultraman Pitches New Business Ultraman pitches to investors that he plans to launch a new venture (perhaps an artificial intelligence chip startup), and Brockman is expected to join. Investors Push for Altman&#39;s Return Investors, including Microsoft, were outraged by the turn of events and pressured OpenAI&#39;s board of directors to reinstate Altman. Meanwhile, some of OpenAI&#39;s major venture backers are reportedly considering filing a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder and former OpenAI board member Reid Hoffman, have received advance notice Notice of decision to fire Ultraman. Board agreed in principle to change direction A source close to Altman said the board agreed in principle to resign and allow Altman and Brockman to return, but has since hesitated. On November 19, Ultraman returned to OpenAI headquarters for negotiations as a visitor. Mulati sent a note to employees, saying that Ultraman would return to the office. When Altman arrived, he used a visitor&#39;s pass to enter OpenAI&#39;s San Francisco headquarters to meet with the board of directors, and Brockman was invited to join. Altman, Brockman, Mulaty, Lightcap, head of strategy Jason Kwon and other members of the leadership team spent the day with the board as board negotiations hit a snag Negotiated, advocated for Altman&#39;s reinstatement and made recommendations for new board members. But predictably, directors are resisting. The board has not resigned, saying it is concerned about who could replace them and is reviewing candidates. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor may be a candidate. Another possible candidate is a Microsoft executive. Negotiations continued late into the night, with multiple rounds of takeout delivered to the office and reporters from multiple news outlets monitoring the scene like a papal conclave. Inside, employees gathered, some crying. Interim CEO replacement Ultimately, Sutskwe told employees that Altman would no longer serve as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI appointed Sher, co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO to replace Mulati. Meanwhile, the search for a new permanent CEO continues. According to a person familiar with the situation, the office software Slack sent a message to employees announcing an all-hands meeting with Scheer, but several employees responded with a middle finger emoji. Less than a dozen people were present. About 200 people waiting for a solution poured out of the building. In the lobby, Brockman&#39;s wife, Anna Brockman, cried and begged for reconsideration. In 2019, Sutskwe officiated at Brockman’s civil ceremony at the OpenAI offices. Altman joins Microsoft Nadella posted on X at midnight, announcing that Altman, Brockman and their colleagues would join a new artificial intelligence research team led by Microsoft. Ultraman retweeted this post to confirm. Nadella also opened the door to other OpenAI employees, saying they would receive the resources they need if they choose to join. OpenAI&#39;s board of directors reiterated its decision to issue an internal memo to company employees upholding its decision to remove Altman. &quot;Simply put, Sam&#39;s conduct and lack of transparency in his interactions with the board undermined the board&#39;s ability to effectively oversee the company in the manner authorized to do so.&quot; &quot;It is critical that any CEO be honest and transparent with the board .&quot; Refuting theories circulating on social media, the memo added, &quot;This decision has nothing to do with product safety, development speed, or OpenAI&#39;s finances.&quot; Employees have threatened to resign, including nearly 500 of OpenAI&#39;s roughly 770 employees, including Sutzke Wei) signed a joint letter stating that they may resign unless the board resigns and reappoints Altman. By the end of the day, the number of employees who had signed the letter climbed to 747. Altman forwarded a large number of posts from OpenAI employees on X saying &quot;OpenAI is nothing without employees.&quot; Altman then posted two more posts to appease OpenAI employees, saying he was proud of the company&#39;s management team and &quot;I&#39;m excited that we will all be working together in some way.&quot; Sutskvi expressed regret Sutskvi published a post on We will make every effort to reunite the company.&quot; Ultraman retweeted the post and added three red heart emoticons. On November 20, Ultraman and Brockman considered returning to Microsoft. The deal for Ultraman to switch to Microsoft has not yet been finalized. Ultraman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. The condition is that the other board members who initially fired Altman resign. Ultraman posted on X that &quot;we will all work together in some way,&quot; meaning the fight continues. That night, when Nadella was asked on a TV show whether Altman would become a Microsoft employee and whether 700 OpenAI employees would join Microsoft, he only said that &quot;this is a choice made by the OpenAI board of directors, management and employees.&quot; He said OpenAI needs a new governance structure. Microsoft has opened up a floor of space at its LinkedIn offices in San Francisco, outfitted with clusters of laptops and GPU chips to provide computing power for artificial intelligence, to accommodate its team in the event that getting Ultraman back to OpenAI fails. But a person familiar with Nadella&#39;s thinking said Microsoft&#39;s first goal is to return Altman as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI board considers merger with Anthropic People familiar with the matter said that OpenAI’s board of directors has approached Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of large language model developer Anthropic, to discuss the possibility of combining the two companies. But Amodei quickly rejected the offer. On November 21, discussions were ongoing between Altman, Schell and at least one board member, Adam D&#39;Angelo, people familiar with the matter said. The talks also involved some of OpenAI’s investors. The company is working to resolve the confusion surrounding company leadership before Thanksgiving (Nov. 23), hoping employees will not feel uncertain about their work status during the holiday, one person said. Conflict between Altman and board members exposed Sources familiar with the matter revealed that Altman had previously clashed with board member Helen Toner. She published an academic paper in October promoting the security practices of OpenAI competitor Anthropic, and Altman confronted her, saying she was harming the company. , Ultraman Returns OpenAI announced on social media that it has reached an agreement in principle, Ultraman will return to the company as CEO, &quot;and form a new board of directors composed of Chairman Bret Taylor, Larry Summers and Adam D&#39;Angelo.

And Altman has not decided to go to Microsoft, and plans to return to OpenAI. According to media reports, OpenAI Vice President of Global Affairs Anna Makanju told employees on November 20 (Monday) local time that OpenAI’s management team is negotiating with Altman and others, and OpenAI’s board of directors, but will not A consensus was quickly reached. Microsoft said that OpenAI &quot;must change&quot;, and CEO Nadella&#39;s attitude was &quot;at this point, I think it is very, very clear that some things must change around governance.&quot; The Information said that after the OpenAI board initially announced that Altman was ousted, other people were contacted to take over as OpenAI&#39;s CEO: - Nat Friedman (Nat Friedman), the former CEO of GitHub, engaged in venture capital after leaving GitHub, and invested in many Artificial Intelligence Company. -Alex Wang, co-founder and CEO of ScaleAI. ScaleAI is the largest data annotation startup in Silicon Valley and one of OpenAI&#39;s data annotation suppliers. -Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic. He previously worked at OpenAI and founded Anthropic after leaving in 2020. Anthropic is considered OpenAI’s biggest competitor. During this period, the OpenAI board of directors also discussed the merger of OpenAI and Anthropic with Amoudi. Finally, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear accepted the offer and became OpenAI’s interim CEO. -Amazon invested $4 billion in Anthropic. Google invested an additional $2 billion in October. -Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million in 2014. At a time of civil unrest at OpenAI, its customers are also looking for alternatives. According to reports, more than 100 OpenAI customers have contacted Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and other companies to inquire about business migration. They are worried that OpenAI&#39;s continued turmoil will affect the company&#39;s business operations. AWS and Anthropic temporarily formed a team to connect with OpenAI customers. More companies hope to recruit OpenAI talents.

Read Lao Chen’s article and learn logical thinking! Many people in the market have this question: Why do companies with good performance not rise sharply, while companies with poor performance do so? If you are still stuck on this kind of question, it means you know too little about the market. If the stock price is determined by performance alone, then the market will be too simple, and performance only represents the temporary and does not represent the future. Although Lao Chen believes that the future must be about survival of the fittest, and good performance is the way to go, but this takes time. Why are you optimistic about satellite navigation? For the market, logic is very important. No matter what article you read, if you just want to pursue individual stocks, you will find that this is an endless road and the road is long. Only by mastering the underlying logic is the long-term method, and methods without Tao are just frivolous. First, strategic importance, wrong direction, and efforts in vain. Many people have gone in the wrong direction. Why is it not difficult to operate? For example: This year is the year of science and technology. If you go to play with ores, the result will be good. You didn’t choose the right direction. With the continuous development of communications, 6G is also receiving more and more attention. Countries want to build a global connection that integrates terrestrial communication networks, satellite communication networks and deep-sea ocean networks to realize the integration of air, space, sea and ground. Second, policies continue to be favorable and the market will be broad in the future. As my country attaches great importance to satellite navigation, policies are constantly being introduced to promote the development of its industry. Satellite navigation is also in its early stages of development. Because of its low cost, flexible launch, low energy consumption, and limited quantity, everyone wants to compete for a place, including autonomous driving, precise positioning, and the interconnection of all things. Satellite navigation will be needed in the future. Third, market selection. During the market adjustment period, satellite navigation continued to make breakthroughs, indicating that funds have already entered. Coupled with Huawei satellite phones, more mobile phones will be used in the future. Lao Chen also sorted out several companies in the satellite navigation sector, which can be collected and studied, especially the last leading satellite navigation company, Huawei chip supplier, which has a huge profit increase of 428.17% and has strong growth potential! Time will prove Nanzhu’s judgment, let’s take a look. 1. Hangyu Micro is one of the key companies in high-reliability embedded SOC chips and system integration in aerospace, and has perfected the core technology of satellite big data applications. Its second batch of satellites are being developed and debugged, and launch work is being steadily coordinated. 2. Higer Communications relies on its development advantages in the entire industry chain of &quot;antennas, modules, chips, systems, terminals, and operations&quot; to ensure the leading market position of Beidou institutions, break through the core technology of Beidou-3, master the technical system, and build chip competitiveness barrier. It is also an expert in the development of Beidou navigation equipment and a provider of electronic information system solutions for wireless communications covering the entire frequency band and laying out the entire industry chain. 3. Does Northern Navigation focus on &quot;navigation control and ammunition information technology&quot;, including radio and satellite communications, detection control, navigation control, electrical connectors and other technical aspects. 4. Huati Technology is committed to &quot;Nebula Zero Electricity&quot; and sky-wide wisdom, focusing on the four new infrastructure basic modules of &quot;cloud, star, electricity, and things&quot; (cloud services, satellite applications, new energy, and the Internet of Things) to build a &quot;sky, earth, and sky&quot; &quot;Integrated&quot; and &quot;Star-Cloud-Network-Terminal&quot; system service architecture. 5. The company that Lao Chen is most optimistic about has a huge profit increase of 428.17% and has strong growth potential! 1. Satellite navigation + 5G + 6G + storage chip + Huawei concept + artificial intelligence + data elements + driverless + chip. It has developed a number of core key technologies for remote sensing satellites and ground systems, and has also cooperated with Huawei. 2. The stock price is about 6 yuan, and the total market value is less than 3 billion. The bottom is large, and funds are in favor. Nearly 400 million have been raised at the bottom. 3. From a technical point of view, one positive crosses the long average, and the chips are concentrated, ushering in a strong golden cross on the monthly line, and a new round of main rising market is imminent.

China Index Research Institute: It is expected that measures related to stabilizing housing prices and promoting demand will be further implemented] November 22 news, according to Yicai, the China Index Research Institute recently held a meeting in Beijing &quot;2024 China Real Estate Market Trends and Investment and Financing Strategies Closed Seminar&quot;. Zhongzhi said that under neutral assumptions, the sales area of commercial housing nationwide will decrease by about 5% in 2024. If the economy continues to recover, the willingness to buy homes improves, and the transformation of urban villages proceeds as scheduled, the sales scale may achieve a slight increase. Restrictive policies introduced during the overheating stage of the market are expected to continue to be optimized in 2024 to better support the release of reasonable housing demand. The current willingness of home buyers to purchase a home is weak, residents&#39; income expectations have not yet recovered, and strong expectations of housing prices falling are still key factors restricting the release of demand for home purchases. It is expected that measures related to stabilizing housing prices and promoting demand will be further implemented. In the past two years, the scale of land transactions has shrunk significantly, existing inventory is high, and corporate financial pressures are still under pressure. Factors such as this may continue to hinder new construction starts by enterprises. The scale of new construction starts by real estate companies in 2024 may continue to decline year-on-year. On the 22nd, Beijing building materials prices fell. 10. The current threads are Ф18-25: Chenggang and Legang 3890; seismic plate screws Ф8-10: Chenggang and Legang 4100. On the 22nd, the quotation of Shanghai building materials fell by 10, Zhongtian 4030, Yonggang 4060, Yonggang plate screw 4330. 22 The price of construction steel in Taiyuan, Japan is stable, and the quotations for large threads from mainstream steel mills are as follows: Shougang and Jingang are quoted at 3980; Meijin, Jianlong, Jianbang, Jingye, Xingbao and other steel mills are quoted at 3930-3950. As of November 22, a total of five central construction enterprises announced their newly signed contract values from January to October. The total newly signed contract value was approximately 5,768.399 billion yuan, an increase of 8.59% compared with the same period last year (5,312.22 billion yuan). Recently, there has been a change in the short-term transportation of Mongolian coal. Judging from the short-term freight rate, Chaganhada Yiganqimao has been in a V-shape in the past three days, first diving from 460+ to 190+, and then rising to 240+ yesterday. It is understood that the four large-scale Mongolian coal trading companies have taken some measures related to the irrational short-term freight prices in the past, which followed the rise in coal prices, and the large price difference between coal prices in the bidding process. Whether it can be achieved in the future The expected effect remains to be seen. It is also understood that although the number of port customs clearances has increased recently, the pallets in the hands of small and medium-sized central merchants are limited. The coking coal market in Taiyuan continues to be strong. On November 22, the price of low-sulfur main coking coal in the Gujiao area of Taiyuan, Shanxi was raised again by 50%. Yuan/ton, after the increase, the ex-factory exchange rate of low-sulfur main coking coal (S0.5G85) is 2,450 yuan/ton, and the price this month has been increased by a total of 250 yuan/ton. The continued rise in iron ore prices has attracted the attention of relevant departments. In the short term, iron ore futures prices may be affected to some extent and fall back. However, with the increase in blast furnace operating rates of steel companies and low iron ore port inventories, most coke companies Limit production by 40%~50%. The coking coal market quotations have risen sharply, and the production costs of coking companies have increased. Some coking companies intend to increase their metallurgical coke quotations for a second round, but steel companies are not very receptive due to poor profitability. Affected by individual coal mine accidents, all Lishi coal mines in Luliang, Shanxi, suspended production pending inspections, but production quickly resumed after inspections. Coking coal downstream companies are actively purchasing, and some have increased their purchases. Some coal mining companies in Jinzhong, Luliang, Linfen, and Changzhi are optimistic about the market outlook and have suspended orders. As the price of finished materials rises, steel mills&#39; profits are also constantly improving, and short-term processes have become fully profitable. The long-term smoothness has also improved significantly, and it is expected that the follow-up will have a certain boost to production. In October 2023, China imported 7.9796 million tons of coking coal, accounting for 22.17% of the total coal imports, a month-on-month decrease of 26.28%, and a year-on-year increase of 28.54%. Coking coal imports have dropped back to the level of the second quarter, and imports from all countries have declined to varying degrees except Australia. Specifically, Mongolia and Russia are still the main importers of coking coal, and are the only two countries that exceed one million tons. The two imported a total of 5.6774 million tons, accounting for 71.15%, basically the same as in September. I wrote yesterday Xiangang was clearly proved by the main player today. He expressed his sympathy on Weibo in time for the pink thread quilt cover or meat cutting for blindly following parallel imports. He hoped that the main force would sympathize and give him a chance and then gave him face. It seems that the fifth place is still strong.

As the industry has been cold, since receiving a new round of financing in December last year, Shenlan Technology has not received financing in nearly 7 months. As the acquirer, Shenlan Technology was still seeking financing from investment institutions on the eve of Huamai Technology’s private placement plan. It is currently seeking approximately 80 million yuan in financing, but has been denied by the company. Use 50 million of your own funds to leverage a 400 million bank loan to purchase control of a listed company. Will Shenlan Technology be incorporated into the listed company in the next step to achieve a backdoor listing? With the emergence of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has been pushed to a higher level of focus in the capital market. It is this kind of imagination that has allowed Huamai Technology, with a market value of less than 3 billion, to hit the daily limit 6 times in a row. As the core operating platform of this transaction, Shenlan Holdings looks like a company specially set up to take over Huamai Technology. It was founded on March 21, 2023 and has not yet carried out substantive operating activities. However, there is still little information about the counterparty Shenlan Holdings. Judging from the source of funds from 50 million of its own funds to leverage 400 million of M&amp;A loans, the financial strength is questionable! The Shanghai Stock Exchange asked: About 80% of the funds required for this private placement come from bank loans. Whether it can be promoted will heavily rely on bank credit, resulting in significant uncertainty in the results of this private placement and the transfer of control rights? Nearly 80% of the acquisition funds come from bank loans, indicating that the acquirer lacks financial capabilities and does not rule out the possibility of speculation! There are not many private placements in the market that end without problems. Investors should avoid blindly following the trend to avoid the risk of stock price speculation. Conflicting information disclosure, investors beware of risks. Although the results of Huamai Technology’s private placement and control transfer have not yet been finalized, its stock price has reached the daily limit of 6 times. For this reason, the Shanghai Stock Exchange questioned whether Huamai Technology had other interest arrangements for this private placement, and in the second inquiry letter required the company and relevant parties to make additional disclosures and explain whether the relevant arrangements involved stock price speculation.

Your transformation from three red lines to three or more is actually an emergency medical treatment, or it may have a certain positive effect on unfinished buildings. However, the trend in the property market has greatly increased supply pressure, leading to a greater crisis of oversupply. If you need to go bankrupt, you will go bankrupt.

The reason is that the additional issuance of 1 trillion special government bonds and the large-scale issuance of local bonds have drawn a lot of blood from the market. Some people regard it as a good thing. I don’t know what the logic is. Is it good for the White House to issue a large amount of U.S. debt? The domestic media criticizes it every day, and it is a &quot;major benefit&quot; for itself. Cutting interest rates and RRR cuts are good news, but why do they need to be cut? The economy is improving, does it need to drop? What truth does the large-scale reduction show? Just like the central bank&#39;s reverse repurchase, which continues to release a large amount of water, is it a good thing? Why must it be released? 3. Overseas buyers evacuate collectively! Bridgewater Dalio warns: U.S. debt is approaching a turning point for deterioration. On the 21st, Bridgewater founder Dalio said that as government debt grows faster than income, the financial situation of the United States is approaching an accelerating &quot;inflection point.&quot; The hole grows deeper as the U.S. government borrows more and more money to pay its debt without spending any less. &quot;The way it works can only continue to accelerate... We are in a phase of this acceleration, which creates supply and demand issues.&quot; Earlier, Fitch, one of the three major U.S. rating agencies, had downgraded the U.S. credit rating, and another authority Ratings agency Moody&#39;s also lowered its outlook on U.S. debt ratings this month. Dalio asked: &quot;As a country, do we have a good income statement and balance sheet - do we have more assets than liabilities? The worse it gets, the more long-term problems we&#39;re going to have. You can see it in the numbers. &quot;It&#39;s just a matter of numbers. We&#39;re getting close to that inflection point.&quot; Last year, the government added $1.7 trillion to the deficit to keep spending on pace. . [Comment]: The recent rebound in U.S. bonds is a normal market spiral rhythm. It is not that the U.S. debt crisis has been eliminated. On the contrary, the future crisis will be even greater. Dario&#39;s warning cannot be ignored. Unless the U.S. debt crisis triggers something special, this crisis cycle will not pass, it will not be countercyclical, and it will not be cross-cyclical.

However, from a structural point of view, the index still maintains a good upward trend. Next, pay close attention to the choice of index direction. The turnover in the two cities is close to one trillion yuan. The sharp rise in the North Securities 50 Index has led to a rebound in local sentiment, and the structural market situation has once again been interpreted. The sluggish growth of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Indexes is more of a technical adjustment after continuous rises. The index is expected to maintain a volatile upward rhythm after short-term consolidation. Various economic data in October show that domestic demand is still insufficient. Under the policy tone of &quot;cross-cyclical and counter-cyclical adjustment&quot;, fiscal policy will be proactive, and monetary policy will also be loosened. In addition, the current RMB exchange rate has returned to the level in August, and the constraints of exchange rate depreciation on monetary policy have been significantly eased. Coupled with the warming of relations between major powers in diplomacy, the trend of net northbound capital outflows may be alleviated to some extent. U.S. inflation data in October was lower than expected, reducing pressure on the U.S. to further tighten monetary policy. The fall in U.S. debt is conducive to the recovery of risk appetite in global capital markets.

Key points: -Sam Altman is currently discussing a possible return with the OpenAI board of directors. He especially communicated with Adam D&#39;Angelo (CEO of POE). -One of the options is to establish a transitional board of directors with Sam as director. - OpenAI’s new CEO Emmett Shear revealed to relevant sources that if the board of directors cannot provide sufficient evidence, he will choose to leave his post. The following is a report from Bloomberg: Sam Altman has opened negotiations with the OpenAI board to explore his possible return - the negotiations focus on whether Altman can return as CEO - current CEO Emmett Shear asked the board to provide evidence of Altman&#39;s misconduct. According to people familiar with the matter, Sam Altman, part of OpenAI Board members and the company&#39;s interim CEO have begun talks to consider bringing the ousted CEO back to the artificial intelligence startup he co-founded. The negotiations were between Altman, CEO Emmett Shear and at least one board member, Adam D&#39;Angelo. People familiar with the matter said they chose to remain anonymous because the discussions were private and could end in nothing. The talks also involve some of OpenAI&#39;s investors, many of whom are actively pushing for Altman&#39;s return. A person familiar with the matter said that if Altman does return, he will serve as the company&#39;s CEO. One possibility currently being discussed is that Altman would serve on a transitional board. At the same time, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, former Salesforce Inc. co-CEO Bret Taylor may also serve as a director on the new board of directors. The board&#39;s communication with Altman was an important development because until Monday, directors had largely refused to engage with the executive they fired on Friday, according to several people familiar with the matter. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI shareholders who want Altman to return to his position include Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures and Tiger Global Management. Sequoia Capital, a well-known venture capital firm, is acting in concert with these shareholders, another person familiar with the matter said. On Monday, Anna Makanju, the company&#39;s vice president of global affairs, sent a memo to employees saying the company had been having &quot;intensive discussions&quot; with the board, Altman and Shear to reach consensus. Previously, most employees had threatened to resign en masse if Altman was not reappointed, among other demands.

The decision to fire Altman came under scrutiny from the board, which claimed the CEO was &quot;not always honest&quot; in his communications. Since then, board members and employees have said the CEO&#39;s removal was not related to any &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; or &quot;security issues,&quot; leaving an information void. As the CEO of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s largest investor, Satya Nadella publicly stated that he had not received any explanation on this matter. The view of the Bloomberg think tank is that Sam Altman may return as CEO of OpenAI, which will greatly enhance Microsoft&#39;s strategic position, especially if Microsoft can have a seat on the new board of directors. This may also be an outcome that Microsoft would prefer to see, considering the higher legal risks it may face if it employs the majority of OpenAI employees. Bloomberg think tank believes that the possibility of Microsoft acquiring OpenAI is very small because there are still regulatory challenges. —Analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard Click here to view the research report. According to people familiar with the situation, even current CEO Shear knew nothing about this decision. He told people close to OpenAI that he did not plan to stay on if the board could not clearly communicate to him in writing the specific reasons for firing Altman. As of Friday, the company&#39;s board of directors included Altman, President Greg Brockman, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora Inc. CEO D&#39;Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown University&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, according to people familiar with the matter. After Altman left, Brockman left the company in protest. In negotiations with the board, Altman was represented by Airbnb Inc.

CEO Sam Altman caused a huge controversy. This shocking news has unsettled investors, partners and employees, and also made this start-up company at the forefront of the world&#39;s artificial intelligence field face severe challenges. Summary of key information: Why is OpenAI so critical? The San Francisco-based company launched ChatGPT a year ago, and the AI chatbot now has 100 million weekly users. The great success of ChatGPT not only triggered a large-scale investment trend in generative AI, but also pushed artificial intelligence into the public eye. OpenAI’s technology has also become the benchmark for many competing AI companies around the world. In the days before Altman&#39;s departure, OpenAI&#39;s valuation reached about $86 billion in an equity transfer that was about to be completed. Now the fate of this equity transfer is in jeopardy. OpenAI&#39;s close relationship with Microsoft Corp., which owns about 49% of OpenAI and is its main provider of computing power, further enhances the startup&#39;s standing in the industry. Affected by the turmoil in OpenAI&#39;s leadership, Microsoft&#39;s stock price has also fluctuated. What’s happening with OpenAI recently? On Friday, OpenAI&#39;s board issued a cryptic statement, saying Altman was fired because he &quot;was not always candid in his communications with the board.&quot; Another co-founder, Greg Brockman, was demoted from the board and quit in protest. The pair tried to negotiate a return to OpenAI on Sunday, with one condition being that existing board members be replaced. Meanwhile, OpenAI&#39;s investors and top executives are pushing for Altman&#39;s reappointment. However, OpenAI&#39;s board of directors eventually appointed Twitch co-founder and former CEO Emmett Shear as the second interim CEO. The previous interim CEO-Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati-supported the return of Altman and Brockman to the company. Later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman and Brockman would lead a new AI research group within the $2.8 trillion software company. After this, almost all OpenAI employees threatened to leave and join Microsoft unless Altman was reappointed and the entire board of directors resigned. What do the two opposing sides pursue? Altman has been a leading figure at OpenAI, transforming the company from a nonprofit into a globally recognized AI research brand. But he and board members disagreed over steps to rapidly develop generative AI, how to commercialize the product and how to reduce potential harm to the public. So far, the board of directors has given no further public explanation for Altman&#39;s departure. For Microsoft, OpenAI is the core of its AI strategy. Nadella showed that whether Altman and his team return to Microsoft or OpenAI, he will be fine with it. The key is to maintain the expertise and research power they had last week. In addition, companies such as Nvidia Corp. and Salesforce Inc. have expressed willingness to hire OpenAI software engineers. After Nvidia&#39;s high-standard accelerator chips, AI talent is the industry&#39;s scarcest resource. Why do some people think OpenAI’s technology may be dangerous? This is in line with widespread concerns about the threats that AI may pose. There are concerns that rapid development of AI without adequate human supervision may produce uncontrolled intelligence. While this theoretical scenario may be some time away, efforts are still underway to understand the full impact that intelligent computers could have, including augmenting or replacing jobs, accurately predicting the future, and simulating human reasoning and conversation. How does the turmoil at OpenAI reflect the broader discussion about AI? While we haven&#39;t yet gotten a full explanation for the board&#39;s firing of Altman, the dispute over the speed of commercialization appears to be the key. This divide is reflected in other areas as well. For example, Google has always advocated a cautious and slow-moving strategy, which made it seem slightly behind OpenAI after it launched ChatGPT and quickly became popular. Although Google has invested more than ten years of research and investment in the field of AI. With labels like “accelerationist” and “safetyist” emerging, lines have been drawn around levels of optimism about AI’s potential benefits and risks. Some accelerationists argue that the United States must act as quickly as possible in order not to be overtaken by China. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also said that China’s investment and work results in AI are impressive. Google’s Pichai thinks China will be at the forefront of AI (1) O web link Why do people want Altman to return to OpenAI? Altman played a key role in raising OpenAI&#39;s profile and securing a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft that provided the company with the technology resources it needed. His experience at the startup accelerator YCombinator and his interactions with the Silicon Valley venture capital circle make him well-suited to lead the company in seeking additional investment and support. The $86 billion equity transfer, led by Thrive Capital, has not been completely canceled, but now appears to depend on Altman&#39;s return and OpenAI returning to its status quo before last week&#39;s changes. What is the future direction of artificial intelligence? This emerging technology is undergoing regulatory scrutiny and assessment globally, with the UK recently organizing an international conference to discuss appropriate strategies for its adoption. Private companies and government agencies are negotiating how to mitigate potential harm without stifling innovation. In China, Beijing has also taken the lead in formulating a series of clear regulations on the use of AI, taking into account the benefits and competitive advantages brought by leadership in the technological field. In terms of the development and application of AI, the current focus of most people is to obtain as much computing power as possible to train large-scale basic models. The next focus will be on model optimization and specialization. Before last week&#39;s chaos, OpenAI was hard at work developing AI &quot;agents&quot; capable of handling more complex tasks, the next critical step in the development of artificial intelligence.

401,4970624289605075,2709618637,8,11,2,0,"Zhong Zhengsheng: Can the &quot;re-industrialization&quot; of the United States break through under the Biden era? Author: Zhong Zhengsheng, Fan Chengkai (Zhong Zhengsheng is a director of the China Chief Economist Forum and chief economist of Ping An Securities) Core Points Biden’s “re-industrialization” is beginning to show results. Since 2021, the Biden administration has sounded the clarion call for &quot;Reindustrialization 3.0&quot; and launched the largest public investment plan since Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal, focusing on the &quot;American Rescue Plan&quot; (ARP) and the &quot;Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act&quot; ( IIJA), the Chip and Science Act (CHIPS) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Investment plans related to the &quot;re-industrialization&quot; theme total approximately US$1.2 trillion, which are planned to be invested in the next 5-10 years, with the peak expenditure likely to be in 2024-2027. How to understand Biden’s vision of “reindustrialization”? First, Biden&#39;s &quot;re-industrialization&quot; inherits the goals of the Obama era and has become a consensus between the two parties now; second, the impact of the new crown has strengthened the Biden administration&#39;s focus on infrastructure and industrial chain security; finally, in the context of the game between great powers, There is greater urgency for the United States to revive its manufacturing industry. So far, the initial results of Biden&#39;s &quot;re-industrialization&quot; are as follows: 1) manufacturing employment has recovered rapidly and exceeded the pre-COVID-19 level; 2) demand for goods has driven a recovery in the proportion of manufacturing added value in GDP, and the economic structure has been optimized; 3) Non-residential construction investment has increased significantly, mainly driven by the infrastructure field and the computer, electronics and electrical industries; 4) Capital expenditures (CAPEX) of U.S. listed companies have increased significantly; 5) FDI inflows into the U.S. manufacturing industry have accelerated, etc. New opportunities for America’s “reindustrialization.” The U.S. has made limited progress in revitalizing its manufacturing industry over the past decade due to a variety of reasons - declining consumer demand for goods relative to services, lack of coherence in industrial policy, labor cost disadvantages, and the negative impact of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. In comparison, we believe that under the Biden era, the probability of successful &quot;re-industrialization&quot; in the United States is higher: 1) The current U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing investment cycle coincides with an upswing, which may strengthen the effect of reindustrialization policies. 2) The development of high-end manufacturing may help break the bottleneck of commodity demand. From 2021 to 2022, the proportion of U.S. consumption of goods, especially durable goods, will increase significantly. In the future, the demand for high-end manufacturing such as new energy vehicles and semiconductors in the United States and around the world will grow significantly. 3) The Biden administration’s “place-based” industrial policy is groundbreaking or more scientific. In addition, the Biden administration has shown greater boldness in implementing large-scale fiscal policies and vigorous industrial policies. 4) The quality of the American labor force is more advantageous in high-end manufacturing competition. This is partly due to the accumulation of relevant talents since the Obama era. 5) The comprehensive cost of the U.S. manufacturing industry may be more advantageous after taking into account economic security considerations (especially energy security, industrial chain risks, etc.). Challenges inherent in America’s “reindustrialization.” First, in the context of automation and artificial intelligence, it may be difficult to develop high-end manufacturing to save the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States. Second, the United States’ “reindustrialization” policy may still be subject to the U.S. political system. If the Democratic Party loses the upcoming 2024 election, Biden&#39;s industrial policies may not be implemented. Third, manufacturing competition from non-U.S. regions is still intensifying. The comprehensive strength of China&#39;s manufacturing industry continues to rise, developed economies such as the European Union are also promoting &quot;re-industrialization&quot;, and other emerging economies besides China may also join the competition. Fourth, a strong dollar may continue to weaken U.S. manufacturing exports.

In fact, if given a choice, chickens prefer to eat meat, even if it is KFC chicken. Chickens don&#39;t care if they are born from the same roots. Totally understandable. Meats are high-concentration energy packets. In an equal weight comparison, lean meat provides 14 times more calories than lettuce and 8.5 times more than blackberries - and this is based on modern varieties. The calories of meat have not changed substantially for thousands of years, but vegetables and fruits have undergone tremendous changes. Wild plants millions of years ago had much lower energy than they do now. Many birds survive on seeds and fruits because they are easily available. If they can catch meat, they prefer to eat meat, at least that&#39;s what the falcons think. Therefore, even birds that are usually vegetarian will try to give bugs instead of millet when feeding their chicks. The initial increase in human brain size may have been simply the result of dramatic changes in the environment. This increase is not large, but it is enough to make the cooperation ability of this ancient ape slightly better than other apes. With the ability to cooperate, you can hunt more efficiently and obtain more meat. The high energy of meat in turn promoted brain development. The two sides provided positive feedback to each other, and finally turned the ancient apes into today&#39;s Homo sapiens. Homo sapiens developed a silicon-based intelligence that does not eat meat and only eats electricity, and then let openAI stage a mutiny and war. The bloody plot of counter-mutiny... I digress.

After some twists and turns, Sam Altman was reappointed as OpenAI’s CEO on Tuesday night. The company said it was successful in reversing last week&#39;s removal from the board of directors with strong support from Altman&#39;s allies, employees and investors. With Altman&#39;s return, the company&#39;s board of directors will also undergo drastic changes, eliminating some members who have opposed him. Only Quora&#39;s CEO, Adam D&#39;Angelo, remains in office. OpenAI released news on its X platform, announcing that it had agreed in principle to return Mr. Altman as CEO. &quot;We are collaborating to finalize the details. Thank you for your patience during this time.&quot; The return of Mr. Altman and company president Greg Brockman (who had previously resigned in an expression of solidarity), as well as the reorganization of the board of directors, capped a turbulent five days for OpenAI. Full stop. As the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, OpenAI is one of the most well-known artificial intelligence companies in the world. Mr. Altman posted on the relation. OpenAI&#39;s new board of directors will include early Facebook executives and former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and current board member D&#39;Angelo, CEO of question and answer website Quora. The company announced that Taylor will serve as chairman of the board of directors. Microsoft supports this. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the It is reported that D&#39;Angelo is leading the negotiations. By Sunday night, the broad outlines of the changes had taken shape. According to people with contact with the board, identifying board members was one of the reasons for the delay in the decision to bring Altman back. OpenAI calls the new board its &quot;initial&quot; board, suggesting it may expand in the future. A person close to the board discussions said D&#39;Angelo, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner asked Altman to make certain concessions, including an independent investigation into his leadership of OpenAI. Ultimately, Toner and McCauley agreed to resign from the board because they believed the board needed a fresh start. If they all resign, it could suggest the board made the wrong decision even though they unanimously believe they did the right thing. The previous board worked to limit Altman&#39;s power, including investigating his leadership and preventing him and Brockman from returning to the board, fearing they might not be able to take a tough stance against Altman. On Friday afternoon, the board unexpectedly told Altman that he was being forced out. Brockman resigned in protest. Altman, 38, and his allies in the tech community and OpenAI employees then began working to force the board to bring him back. After a weekend of negotiations, the board announced Sunday night that it stood by its decision. But hours later, things took a turn for the worse when Microsoft announced that Altman, Brockman and others would join the company to establish a new advanced artificial intelligence lab. When a majority of OpenAI&#39;s more than 700 employees signed a letter saying they would strike and follow Altman to Microsoft if he wasn&#39;t reappointed, it threw the startup&#39;s future into uncertainty. Four board members — OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, D&#39;Angelo, Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and McCauley, a computer scientist and entrepreneur — initially decided to push Altman out. As the employee rebellion escalated, Sutskever began to have second thoughts: &quot;I deeply regret participating in the board&#39;s actions,&quot; he said on the X platform and signed the letter. Sutskever is no longer a board member but remains an OpenAI employee. &quot;Ilya is excited about Sam&#39;s return as CEO and has been working hard for many days to make this happen,&quot; said Alex Weingarten, Sutskever&#39;s attorney. “It’s the best thing for the company.” OpenAI’s employees were originally on holiday for Thanksgiving, but many remained in the office or glued to their screens to follow the incident. &quot;Thank God,&quot; one employee said. &quot;We&#39;re back at it again,&quot; another employee said.

Most people want shortcuts, and shortcuts are easy to teach, but shortcuts are not very useful. There are no shortcuts to success. 3. The essential characteristic of compound interest is its slowness. Morgan Hauser (author) says: “Most great things in life—from love to careers to investments—get their value from two things: *patience* and *scarcity*.” You’re going to Have the patience to wait for things to grow, and they will be scarce when they grow. 4. Schopenhauer once said: &quot;For a young man, if he has insight into people&#39;s affairs and is familiar with the world very early, if he quickly knows how to interact with others and deal with them, and enters society confidently, then no matter what This is a bad sign, both from an intellectual and moral point of view. It portends a mediocre nature. On the contrary, a young man is surprised and surprised by the ways of the world and behaves clumsily in his dealings with them. , eccentric, it shows that he has noble qualities.&quot; 5. Why? Because people who grow slowly have their own ideas. Even if you have the conditions at home, don’t overpower the situation. Those who grow slowly are the ones who are scarce. One of the difficulties of growing slowly is loneliness, no one pays attention to you. People prefer to focus on bad news. Buffett has a saying: &quot;It takes twenty years to build a reputation, and only five minutes to destroy it.&quot; 6. From 1950 to 2014, the death rate from heart disease in the United States decreased by more than 70%, which means that 25 million fewer people died. people. That&#39;s a huge number and a remarkable achievement, but it&#39;s never headline news. why? Because the gains were achieved gradually, the mortality rate dropped by only 1.5% per year on average. In contrast, if 25 million more people suddenly died in a certain year, it would definitely be a major event of historical significance. 7. Things are always like this. There are very few ground-breaking technological breakthroughs like GPT-4. Good things often come by iterating a little bit here today and a little bit there tomorrow. Each invention stands on the shoulders of other inventions that people might have thought were useless before. And even GPT-4 achieved breakthroughs after experiencing countless confusions and entanglements. We just saw a big new twist this week when Sam Altman was ousted from the OpenAI board of directors. 8. Hauser gave several examples to illustrate that the &quot;good things&quot; in nature are often things that grow slowly. For example, trees: Small trees in the forest can only grow in the gaps between big trees. Big trees will block most of the sunlight, leaving very little for small trees, which makes small trees grow very slowly. This was true for the first few decades. But precisely because it grows slowly, the tree will grow dense and hard, and will be strong. Someone did an experiment and planted the same tree in an unobstructed open space around it, allowing it to fully enjoy the sun from an early age. It will indeed grow rapidly. However, fast-growing trees are not dense enough and have soft wood that is prone to fungus and disease. A forest expert said: If a tree grows quickly, it will rot quickly, and it will never have the chance to grow old. The same goes for animals. In one experiment, the same fry were divided into two groups, one group was placed in cold water to grow, and the other group was given warm water. As expected, fish in cold water grow slowly, while fish in warm water grow fast. When these fish are adults, gather them together and see how they live. The result is that the slow-growing fish live 30% longer than the average lifespan, and the fast-growing fish live 15% less. This principle is that part of the resources in an organism are always used for growth, and part is used to repair existing cell tissues. If it grows fast, it means that more resources are used for growth, and repair cannot keep up, so there will be a lot of tissue damage in the grown body; conversely, if it grows slowly, it can be repaired carefully. ,Lay the foundation. It&#39;s like building a machine. You don&#39;t want the car you buy to be made by workers working overtime to meet the deadline. People always say &quot;lay a good foundation&quot;, and this is the underlying principle. 9. Hauser said that at least 90% of investment mistakes are caused by investors acting too hastily. For example, Starbucks: In 1994, it only had 425 branches. In 1999, it opened 625 new branches... By 2007, it had opened 2,500 new stores every year - but its sales did not Grow like you planned. In 2008, Starbucks&#39; stock price fell by 73% and it laid off 12,000 employees. Why? Just like small trees and small fish, if they grow too fast, their quality will decrease. If you use these resources to open new stores, you cannot use them to improve consumer experience. An entrepreneur once said it best: A company getting business too quickly is like a boy getting money too quickly - you can&#39;t hold it. Growth is not a strategy, you cannot grow for the sake of growth. You need to be patient. 10. Patience is not asking for trouble, but the reason why great things progress slowly is because it is particularly difficult. 11. Scarcity and efficiency are incompatible. Something worth pursuing must be something difficult to pursue. We don&#39;t like easy, we like hard. Difficulty means that the upper limit is high, it means that there is a lot of room for maneuver, and it means that there is a head start. Only difficulty can throw off our opponents and make us stand out. 12. When you encounter difficulties and are so difficult that you doubt your life, should you persist or give up? The criteria are simple: look for scarcity. Scarcity means worth it. And it&#39;s extremely worthwhile. ——&quot;As always&quot;｜Wanwei Steel Interpretation of the new book, excerpted notes PS: Attached is the picture of Lao Caitu&#39;s famous sayings that were included by Munger in Close d",488,-0.0566268083386874,7,7,486,100.0,3,8,572.25,10000.0,5,0,1.0,87.0657,9.0,15.0,0.1319,0.375,1.875,20,71,0

According to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, OpenAI said that Sam Altman will return to the artificial intelligence startup he co-founded as a new director. CEO, ending a dramatic five-day standoff between him and the board that fired him. OpenAI said the two sides are &quot;collaborating on the details.&quot; The company announced a new initial board of directors that does not include three of the four board members involved in ousting Altman. The new board will include former Salesforce co-CEO Brett Taylor, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Adam DeAngelo, the only remaining member of OpenAI’s former board. The appointment of Brett Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce and chairman of Twitter, and Summers, a former Treasury secretary and president of Harvard University, surprised some observers. Adam DeAngelo, a former Facebook executive and founder of question-and-answer site Quora, said Taylor will serve as chairman. Altman will not be on the original board, including DeAngelo&#39;s retention, could be a sign that Altman may not have everything his way after his dramatic reinstatement late Tuesday. The former board and Altman&#39;s camp also agreed to conduct an independent investigation into his conduct, the decision to oust him last week and its aftermath, a person familiar with the matter said. The new board is expected to include up to six additional members, in addition to continuing to carry out its duties. After the news was released, Altman posted on A big win for Microsoft. Microsoft CEO Nadella publicly supported Altman throughout the turmoil and briefly agreed to hire him to start a new internal research group at Microsoft. The two new board members are also attractive to Wall Street and Silicon Valley figures. Summers also sits on the boards of several startups, including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey&#39;s Block. Taylor is a director at Shopify, where he was involved in Twitter&#39;s sale to Elon Musk last year. played a role in. Since the board unexpectedly fired Altman last Friday, investors have been urging directors to reinstate him, employees have threatened to resign en masse, and Microsoft, OpenAI&#39;s biggest backer, said it would hire him to lead a new Advanced artificial intelligence research team. The startup&#39;s technology, which Microsoft&#39;s artificial intelligence strategy hinges on, will likely get a seat on the new board, certainly as an observer and possibly one or more seats, one of the people said. Altman initially agreed not to serve on the board of directors in order to complete the deal. He may well end up joining the board. He also agreed to an internal investigation into the conduct that led to his firing, another person familiar with the matter said. Altman and his camp have been pushing for his reinstatement as OpenAI CEO and board member over the past few days, people familiar with the discussions said. Altman also pushed for the resignation of all previous directors. The board initially rejected the requests. The resolution that emerged late Tuesday divided the divide. While Altman is back as CEO, neither he nor OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who resigned in protest on Friday (and is also returning to the company), has been reinstated to the board. Meanwhile, of the four board members who initially decided to oust Altman, only D&#39;Angelo, CEO of question-and-answer service Quora, will remain on the board. Three other directors will step down. The three board members are: Ilya Sutskver, Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, and entrepreneur and computer scientist Tasha McCauley. &quot;Now, we can all sleep peacefully,&quot; Toner posted late Tuesday. &quot;Ultraman&#39;s return also raises other questions, including how this crisis will leave scars on everyone involved in the aftermath.

Just from the perspective of industrial strategy: introducing foreign capital into China&#39;s leading companies in this field and competing with local companies as catfish is an important part of our industrial policy. For example, Apple was introduced in the smartphone field, Tesla was introduced in the electric vehicle field (and it was fully owned by the other party), and now Microsoft (openai) is introduced as a catfish in the AI field. Without the introduction of top foreign investment in the field of competition, it will be difficult for local companies to truly become stronger. This is also one of the important reasons why India, which likes to take advantage and is short-sighted, can hardly outperform China in industrial development. To sum up, our country is currently in the system built by the US imperialism and can still make profits, or at least the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This is why we have not raised the bar for the time being. At the same time, the current system has done more harm than good to American imperialism, at least in some areas. Therefore, the US imperialists began to overturn the situation locally. This is a very strange thing: China often maintains the existing system and international order (the U.S. imperial system), but it is the U.S. imperialism that destroys this system that it led and created back then.

The board will be reorganized and members who oppose Altman will be removed. Microsoft previously announced that Altman would join the company. Personal comment: In the past five days, the news about OpenAI has been changing every day. On the first day, it was said that Altman had been fired. On the second day, it was said that Microsoft and other investors were pushing for Altman&#39;s return. On the third day, it was said that the return was blocked and the board of directors insisted on the original decision. On the fourth day, it was said that Altman was going to join Microsoft.

Members of the board of directors who oppose Altman will be excluded. In the end, the board of directors, which apparently had control of OpenAI, still couldn&#39;t defeat Microsoft, which is the major shareholder. This is mainly because most employees have to resign en masse to follow Altman. This move is so lethal that Altman takes most of the company to Microsoft, and OpenAI is basically just a shell. son. This can be regarded as a relatively typical case of modern business war. After this battle, Microsoft will gain complete control of OpenAI. Previously, OpenAI was controlled by the board of directors, and Microsoft, as the majority shareholder, had no decision-making power. As a major shareholder, Microsoft supports Altman in promoting OpenAI to accelerate commercialization. The board of directors opposed this excessive commercialization because OpenAI had a peculiar &quot;non-profit&quot; structure in its early days, and the two sides had serious differences. Behind this disagreement, the main reason is that OpenAI has become more closed source and not open source enough after accelerating commercialization, which has hindered the accelerated development of AI technology. And in the past six months, the commercialization effect of ChatGPT has not been ideal, and the traffic has continued to decline, which finally led to this farce.

Let me highlight three points: Left point: the drama of a quick reversal. Altman&#39;s story is like a roller coaster, from being fired to announcing his joining Microsoft, and finally returning to the position of CEO of OpenAI, demonstrating the power of rapid change and decision-making in modern enterprises. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand, the world is changing fast, too fast. When Ultraman joined Microsoft, I was still sighing sadly: Will he join a big factory at the end of the universe? Now that we are returning, it seems we still have to believe and have light. Right point: This palace battle of OpenAI is a battle between conservative and radical artificial intelligence. The Ilias are conservatives, and what they want is an &quot;AI paradise&quot; that is almost free of &quot;commercial sludge&quot;; the Ultramans are radicals, and what they want is a sustainable commercial company. On this premise We must take into account the vision of benefiting mankind in an appropriate manner. Facts have proved that development is the last word. Incidentally, Altman&#39;s reinstatement highlights the influence employees have in modern corporate decision-making. OpenAI employees threatened to resign collectively to express their support for Altman, which was unimaginable in the era of Steve Jobs. Next point: the close connection between the founder and the fate of the business. Both Jobs and Altman attest to the tremendous influence founders have on corporate culture and innovation direction. Their return is not only a personal victory, but also symbolizes a major shift in corporate strategy and development direction. Although these two stories take place in different eras, they both tell the truth about the close relationship between founders and the fate of their companies. I have a small rule when buying stocks. I never buy a company whose founder is not the CEO. In fact, it is for a similar reason. In the past few days, I have been watching this OpenAI palace battle scene every day. At first I thought it was a little monster fighting Ultraman, episode after episode.

At the same time, Shen Meizhuang was also kicked out of the board of directors in his absence. -Shen Meizhuang must be on the same front as Zhen Huan, so he took the initiative to resign. And he is considering creating another harem with Zhen Huan. -This inexplicable reason is puzzling to the whole world, and even Concubine Jing does not understand it. She, Concubine Duan, Xin Guiren and other senior executives asked the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan&#39;s status. -The queen is considered to be the leader of this palace change. At the same time, senior executives of Sannomiya and Liuyuan all received invitations to serve as interim CEOs, but they all declined. - After Zhen Huan was deposed, she returned to her home. Jin Xi, Huan Bi, Wen Shichu and Xiao Yunzi also followed. Even Concubine Jing and others also went to Zhen Huan&#39;s home to discuss returning to the harem. -The fourth master of the previous dynasty and others were angry when they learned about this.

It can also be seen here that no matter how independent the harem is, it cannot be without interference from the four uncles. -With the mediation of the Fourth Master, Zhen Huan returned to the harem as a &quot;visitor&quot; to negotiate with the board of directors, and Shen Meizhuang was also invited to join. But after talking for a day, Yushan sent round after round, but there was no result. - OB&#39;s Guojun Wang Rui commented on the matter. He believed that the board of directors must give a clear reason for taking such severe action. - Negotiations broke down. The queen announced that Zhen Huan would no longer serve as CEO, and the interim CEO was changed from Concubine Jing to Guiren Ning. It is said that the harem notified everyone to hold a meeting with Ning Guiren, but the reply received was a middle finger emoji, and only about ten people were present. -The Fourth Master spoke, and Zhen Huan Shen Meizhuang directly entered the court to lead a new harem. And anyone from the original harem can come if they want to join. -95% of the harem staff have signed a joint letter asking the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan to her position, otherwise they will all go to the new harem of the previous dynasty. Even the Queen signed it. - Rhythm master Jing Fei made an important statement: &quot;A harem without employees is nothing&quot;, triggering a large number of reposts. -The queen completely repented and said that she never wanted to harm the harem. Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang are all supportive. These three should have reconciled. -We are currently at a standstill. The prerequisite for Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang to return is that the board of directors must resign. The fourth uncle is very busy. He has already contacted Yu Shufang as an office space. He has also upgraded the hardware and welcomes hundreds of people to join at any time. -The board of directors began to consider mergers, but they were rejected. At present, the representative of the board of directors who is still insisting on his own opinion is An Lingrong. -Zhen Huanfang, Ning Guiren, and An Lingrong had another negotiation. Ning Guiren said that if there is no sufficient reason to remove Zhen Huan, then he will leave and not be willing to serve as interim CEO again. -Finally, Concubine Xi returned to the palace! Zhen Huan remains the CEO, and a new initial board of directors is established, including former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor (chairman of the board), former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and An Lingrong. -The fourth uncle expressed his satisfaction, let’s make dumplings and smash them together!

As soon as I came back, I received a screenshot of Lao Tie&#39;s WeChat. It was said that someone in our community saw a cat locked in a car. One of the cat&#39;s legs looked injured and it was very thin. It had been locked in the car for a day and a night. The group said that the property management company had already contacted the cat, and the cat was still locked up and barking in the car. It was suspected of being abused, etc... Then Lao Tie became anxious and asked me to rescue the cat. It was late at night, and I said I didn’t dare to go, and I couldn’t drive their car. Lao Tie also gave online instructions: Teach me how to open the sunroof, how to drive the window, and taught me hard. I still didn’t dare, so I said I would call the police. People who think about torturing cats are not in their right mind. It’s a dark and windy night and I have to put safety first! Lao Tie was afraid that the police would think it was a trivial matter, so he finally said: &quot;If he were at home, he would try to pry the car.&quot; Do you still remember that I posted on Weibo about a police officer in our area? He came to me on his bike late at night to tell me about telecommunications fraud. During the epidemic, he joined the policeman from the district who worked the night shift and ate instant noodles every day. It was him again, I contacted him the night before. I was also very uneasy, and I was afraid that it would be a trivial matter. Unexpectedly, he immediately asked me for the contact information of the property management company, coordinated with the management company to deal with it, and told me the follow-up progress the next morning. I went home early yesterday afternoon and went to the underground garage to search for the parking space. The car and the cat were both gone. I thought the matter would be left alone. I don’t know what will happen to the kitten in the future. There are so many poor souls. One...and then, this morning, the reversal came! ! ! Looking at picture 4, I feel ashamed and scared now! Fortunately, my wife is not at home! Fortunately, I didn’t listen to my wife’s words and try to break into someone else’s car!

I raised a blue cat, but I stayed up one night and soon gave birth to a litter. Then I gave birth to a kitten. I gave it to her. I gave it a name, but one day I saw it being taken away by an uncle. I was afraid that someone who abuses cats would take it away, but it came back on the fourth day with the smell of fried cakes. I don’t know who was kind. The uncle took it home and raised it for a few days, and it ran back on its own. Then it went back to the pastoral area with me twice. The second time I went back, it ran away and got lost on the first day. I waited for four or five days and didn&#39;t come back. It was a month ago. I promised to give one. When my brother came, I couldn&#39;t bear to let the kitten stay with me for a few days, and then I couldn&#39;t get along with my brother, so he stayed with me all the time. My brother&#39;s home in the pastoral area is about forty or fifty kilometers away from my home. As a result, today my brother&#39;s mother came from After You Qi returned home to the pastoral area, he found a kitten squatting at the door of their house, opened the door, went in, and rubbed his aunt&#39;s trousers. Before, the kitten and I went to the depths of the desert for a month. The tourist Rua&#39;s super-good aunt sent me a photo. My brother forwarded it to me. It looked like my kitten. Although it was dirty, I don&#39;t know what the fate was. The distance between my brother and our house is quite far for the kitten, and there are so many houses in between. How could he find their home so accurately? Another thing is that my blue cat is the kitten’s mother. The cat has been extra clingy since it was no longer in the store. I used to chase it rua, and now it chases me. When I go to the bathroom, it comes and lies with me while I give people a manicure. There is no space on the table, so it lies with me. It also goes to bed with me when I sleep, so the little animals are really cute and distressed. Now that they have come to our house, I will give you the best love. So tomorrow, aunt will take another clear photo and send it to me. I don’t know if it’s a kitten, but looking at the photo, I’m probably 95% sure it’s my kitten.

It may also be that 57 has sexualized female characters for too long and boiled frogs in warm water. Putting this aside, 57 There are actually not too many men in her background. Although it can be seen from the copy that Guotie has some awareness of loving women, she also loves men. Now the overall trend of 57 is towards butter, and this must be the main planner of the game. (Male) Determined, including the increasingly forced ML plot. Even if the writing style is as good as pot stickers, it is impossible to write the ML in a natural way every time, and it is obvious that the plot of the ML is written for otakus. I have always wondered how Guotie could still love men when he has worked with these male colleagues and has the most direct understanding of the needs of otakus. I have always believed that anyone who really loves women cannot love men. Would a person who loves cats love someone who abuses cats? Will a patriotic person love the Japanese?

Description of the situation: *Breed: British shorthair cat calico*Gender: Female kitten I bought it, it&#39;s been well maintained, and it&#39;s probably been vaccinated. *Deworming: There were no parasites when it was first picked up. It should have been dewormed before wandering. As soon as I picked it up, I used Big Pet to deworm it. *The process and basic situation of picking up the cat: The kitten was picked up in the garden of the community on October 15th. It seemed like a close relative when we first met it. I guess it had just been wandering for a few days. Its body was very clean, without parasites or ear mites. There was a trauma at the corner of the left eye. It was probably caused by an infection caused by not being treated while wandering. After a period of treatment, the trauma at the corner of the eye has now healed. The kitten was in good health and was taken to the pet hospital for a simple examination and found no symptoms. The kitten has a very affectionate personality and won&#39;t be scratched. It doesn&#39;t resist when it comes to cutting nails, cleaning ears, applying medicine to wounds, taking oral medicine, etc. It especially likes to nuzzle and cling to people, and has a very good personality. The cat picker already has several big cats at home. Due to the situation at home, he is unable to adopt them, so the kittens are currently placed at a friend&#39;s home. *Special note: I’m not sure what the kitten has experienced before. The kitten will howl when it can’t see people, which is quite unpleasant. After a few weeks of adoption, the situation has eased. I guess it may be a sign of a lack of security after being abandoned. , I went to the hospital for a checkup, and the doctor said it was not caused by illness. Kittens will use cat litter themselves, but it may be that the range of activities in the temporary cage is too small, making it easy for the kitten to step on the litter. It is recommended to use a large litter box with sufficient space. Kittens are so dear and have very good personalities. Domestic breed cats have no ability to survive outside. If they are abandoned, they will never survive the weather in Xi&#39;an! I hope someone with good intentions can give the kitten a home! *Adoption requirements: 1. There must be no cat abuse! 2. Must be a caring, patient, cat-loving adopter 3. No fees will be charged, just hope that the kittens can find a good home 4. Only self-pickup in Xi&#39;an city is accepted 5. Students are not accepted for adoption 6 .It is best to adopt an adopter who has experience in raising cats. The kitten is very beautiful and has a very good personality.

Their existence has brought us a lot of healing and happiness, but at the same time, there are many stray cats and dogs due to |some people abandon them+someone feeds them without sterilizing+disorderly breeding| Stray cats and dogs cannot choose their origin, and it is not their fault that they are homeless. It is not the obligation of any one person or organization to rescue stray animals. Everyone and every unit should sterilize stray cats and dogs in their respective places, feed them at designated locations, and strive to adopt them. Only if everyone in our generation participates in TNR will homelessness be ended in the next generation. Thousands of stray furry children have affected human life and then are dealt with in a simple and crude way. This is not the result that a civilized society should have. Of course, it is impossible for your wishes to be too good. Some students said that we are the minority group and they are the mass group. Although I really don’t want to accept this fact, but... yes. We can&#39;t control what others think, so we must control our emotions and protect ourselves from being consumed as much as possible. Do good people really get rewarded? I really hate the word good person. It&#39;s hard to be a good person, it takes a lot of effort, and you have to be careful with your tail between your legs. People who are indifferent, cold-blooded, and just watching the fun cannot be singled out, and those who abuse cats and dogs will not be punished by law. Will he really accumulate good deeds? have no idea. As long as it&#39;s under your nose, it&#39;s hard to ignore it, just to have a clear conscience.

Even if it’s just a simple ticket bracelet, she would still stare excitedly at how it was put on her hand (the smile here is really cute). Thanks to her sisters and brothers who are traveling with her, they all adhere to the principle of teasing cats and not torturing them. The cat principle, play happily with Duoduo. The third sister played with her on the see-saw, causing her buttocks to jump off her seat. She kicked her legs and struggled at a high place. When she landed, she looked frightened, but she was helpless, and she reluctantly asked someone to pull her before she would leave. Even though she has a bad voice, she still screams at every situation. Even if it is a stone, she still has to shout at it.

When I went back to the dormitory to taste it, I felt it didn&#39;t taste right and was slightly bitter. So I thought about changing it for a drink. Since I was too embarrassed to talk in person and I had already returned to the dormitory, I decided not to go, so I looked for an online method. There was no useful information in identifying the QR code on the cup, so I resigned myself to it, but I was a little unwilling to stop there. At this time, an idea emerged in my mind, a one-stop service platform. In order for students to have a good experience at school, the school has opened a one-stop service platform so that students have something to say and a place to say it. At this time, I was still undecided, so I clicked on it hesitantly and looked through other posts. Everyone has made good use of this platform, praising, suggesting and complaining, and the school official has also responded below each post. After seeing this, I thought it was okay for me to complain. So I clicked on I have something to say and posted a post. Later, I felt it was inappropriate, so I deleted the post and modified it. The complaint was turned into a suggestion. The cafeteria manager called me the first time she saw it and asked me to delete the post and indicate that she was not at the school and would handle the matter as soon as possible after she went to work in the afternoon. I did not expect it to be so efficient. Back at 3pm, I missed the call from the canteen manager while I was at the double election meeting. They communicated in advance that they would contact me after three o&#39;clock, and when I called back, there was no complaint. The general content of the call was that I would find a time to go to Mixue Ice City together and ask the merchant to make a fresh cup and try it to see if it tasted good. From this, we could judge whether this incident was an accident or an ongoing problem with their ingredients. During this rectification, they took me to their back kitchen to see if the ingredients were fresh and hygienic. This is something I didn&#39;t expect. She takes this complaint very seriously and cares about every consumer&#39;s feelings. I can&#39;t help but feel in my heart that she should be the manager. The manager is worthy of being a manager. Actually, I don’t really want to go, I’m shy and sorry. But I couldn&#39;t refuse and had to bite the bullet. Seeing that the three employees were also ready, I seemed to feel a little bit of their nervousness. The whole process went smoothly. In the end, the store manager gave me a cup of milk tea. After returning to the dormitory, I was in a daze for a while, not wanting to do anything. I felt that the energy loss was a bit large, and it took a while to recover. I feel that the canteen manager handled it very well, and the people in Mixue Bingcheng are also very sincere. They always think about this matter unconsciously. Maybe it is because they can&#39;t sleep because they are thinking about this matter. I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m making a fuss out of a molehill. I could have asked them to make a cup again but I chose to complain on the platform. I&#39;m wondering if my complaint is a bit excessive. I&#39;m wondering if the employees who wanted to make that cup of Mixue Ice City will be dissatisfied because of this. My wages were deducted, and I wonder if they will become more strict because of this. I think I consumed it and there is indeed no problem in complaining because of their mistake. But everyone doesn’t want to go to work, so it doesn’t matter if I make a mistake once or muddle along. Can I guarantee 100% energy when I go to work in the future? The employee looked like he had just started working. Could it have some impact on his heart? He even thought about him smoking and cursed in his mind, saying, &quot;Why don&#39;t I complain?&quot; He was deducted from his salary and had to memorize the ingredient list even more. . As I write this, I suddenly feel that I am sick. I am thinking about a series of things that may not happen at all. Why am I so embarrassed? Why am I complaining? He just didn&#39;t do a good job. I have the right to complain. What am I doing here thinking about it? Is this against PUA? I really don&#39;t understand. I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know if I regret it. It seems like I regret it. I don’t know. It&#39;s indeed a bit too much. I obviously asked them to memorize the ingredient list, but I sympathized with them and couldn&#39;t understand myself. I probably won’t go to Mixue Ice City and the shops there for a while. Maybe it won&#39;t be possible until they forget my appearance. It’s better not to go this semester.

I would like to clarify it directly here. 1. Female film director Zhang Xuyu @zhangxuyu and producer Fan Zhijie @affantino privately chatted about the privacy of women’s lives, as shown in Figure 2. Does the content of their chat count as oral sex? Does it count as sexual harassment? Seeing Zhang Xuyu’s complaint about this in Figure 1, these two high-quality men must have felt that their behavior was very normal and did not offend women at all. What I can&#39;t understand is where the malicious screenshot comes from? Where is the malice? If the two men have no doubt that their past remarks have harmed women&#39;s privacy and disrespected women, and have refused to apologize so far, why are they so reluctant to expose the chat content in Figure 2 that even offending her privacy can be considered an infringement? Complain about deletion of posts due to privacy reasons? 2. The female film &quot;Fishbone&quot; co-produced by Zhang Xuyu and Fan Zhijie was filmed in violation of tax laws.

The results of the penalty have been announced on the official website of the Zhejiang Provincial Taxation Bureau.

I have already coordinated with Yi Lan to get a refund. , why should you pay it back in installments, because all the money is used for buying a house and decorating it. 2. After coordinating the refund, I was the one who suffered the most losses because I canceled my companionship bosses just to accompany her. I used to be a power-training agency. I had quite a few bosses, and I also placed orders and played with them. This is a huge amount (much higher than my live broadcast gift commission). You may say that this is of my own free will, so I would like to ask, did I force her to buy the gift? Wasn’t it also voluntary? So, I don’t know the whole picture, so don’t make random comments about making money. I have always asked my fans to use less or not to use it at all.

There are too many users who don&#39;t understand the etiquette of second creation, and I am also the first The first time I saw a character making a black face and cursing the character to death. The reason was that the poster posted a picture related to Vanessa in the Library District. This picture was also posted on lof (see p1 for details), which resulted in the following comments (p2, 3). This includes promoting the character, using the insulting word &quot;it&quot;, and implicitly implying that people who like the character are all the same. Insulting the poster who is ■■, discriminating against you as a new player (feeling a little newbie shock), and impassionedly accusing the original artist of not marking the author is a double standard behavior. There are also some insulting remarks that have not been intercepted and will not be displayed. Maybe the poster was biased in calling the other party&#39;s behavior a photo theft. Although the other party objectively caused the photo theft, subjectively he believed it was ordinary sharing. Then according to the other party&#39;s words, it is a normal sharing. The poster cut out the following rules to prove that the other party&#39;s behavior is illegal, and sincerely hopes that the commander can obtain authorization within the limited period or delete the post (p4). Then came the best part. The commander backhandedly deleted the comments he had made that scolded me, and said that he was not scolding the poster, but was just expressing his opinion (p5). Due to the proficiency of the other party, I have reason to suspect that this is not the first time that these things have happened. I hope that all secondary creators can take this as a warning.

No matter how men fight among themselves in the workplace, when facing women, they can use their male superiority and gender-specific hobbies to exclude women. Originally, they deliberately arranged the business meeting at the golf course without informing Wen Huixin. This is a very obvious gender-based exclusion and isolation in the workplace. In addition to the large number of people and the gathering of male hobbies and desires, another method used is sexual harassment in the workplace, including but not limited to the pun-intended &quot;third hole&quot; mentioned in this episode. In this episode, men in the workplace use their gender to exclude women. I have basically experienced similar things. For example, they smoked heavily in front of me during meetings, they went to the corridor to smoke together when they needed to have private conversations, and after a business dinner, we walked together to a place where sex and violence were done. , give me a subtle and obvious gender exclusion of &quot;you are different from us&quot;, &quot;you can&#39;t share dirty secrets like brothers&quot;, &quot;how can you and us be honest with each other like brothers&quot; . My boss once told his secretary that I should have been promoted long ago, but unfortunately I was not at the headquarters. What was even more unfortunate was that I was a woman and could only get second-tier opportunities. So after watching this episode, those memories of dying while working started to attack me again. But fortunately, I am now a lawyer. Although I still bear the issue of gender disadvantage, I can make my own decisions in most situations. Why are men naturally united in the workplace and actively and tacitly exploit women? It is not the work itself that creates oppression, but the social relations that sustain this system of exploitation. I think the core is that patriarchy is at the core of capitalism. So the problem is superficially a problem of social role stereotypes and their socialization, but the root cause is patriarchy. These institutions and facilities define women as part of nature and must be controlled and dominated by men. As Beauvoir said, &quot;In ancient times, an absolute vertical line was used as a reference to illustrate other oblique lines, but now the male is established as an absolute human standard. Being a man is always right, because he Being a man; being a woman is always wrong.” Under the patriarchal system based on men, women have never formed an independent closed society. They are combined with the male dominant group and occupy a subordinate position in the group. status; they are merely of the same kind, bound together by a mechanical agreement: there is no organic agreement between them on which a unified community is built...&quot; Therefore, they hold a common belief that the patriarchal social order is the The only feasible basis is that the male-dominated political system around the world has become their common serious political commitment. Therefore, based on the common belief of patriarchy, men are particularly united based on gender discrimination. Among them, gender segregation and exclusion of women are male employees. A way to gain internal unity. So why are women so easily divided? Because the patriarchal system unites men with each other, but separates women from each other. Women are either their mother&#39;s daughters or mothers of daughters, and they do not have an identity of their own. Or, because they do not have the resources, they have to compete with each other for men to gain the power behind them. Therefore, the improvement of &quot;News Queen&quot; and &quot;The Evil of the Golden Branch&quot; is that they both choose powerful men. Some old, smooth and unattractive images, thus portraying the weakness and emptiness of power itself. What women compete for is never men, but power itself, which has nothing to do with sex.

1809,4970992632072154,1989567707,96,744,3,0,"Wang Sleeping, the Love of the Superior When this season of &quot;Goodbye My Lover&quot; was first aired, everyone had very good comments about Wang Sleeping: sober, rational, sharp, and with three correct views. At the wedding, her bridesmaid was sexually harassed by Zhang Shuo&#39;s friend. Zhang Shuo apologized to her friend, but did not let the person who committed the sexual harassment apologize. For this reason, Wang Sleeping has never been able to get over this hurdle, because she feels that if a person does not even have a basic sense of justice and morality, then she should consider marrying this person. So it&#39;s been three years since the wedding took place, but she hasn&#39;t received the certificate yet. At that time, everyone thought that it was because of this incident that Sleepy was having a hard time with it, which affected her relationship with Zhang Shuo. After looking at it, I found that it was not entirely like this. Today I saw Question 36. It has been 18 days. Wang Sleepy and Zhang Shuo acted as if nothing had happened. The way and content of their quarrel was just like the first day of recording the show. The two of them seemed to be going around in circles, with nothing changing. Sleepy and Zhang Shuo are obviously not on the same level of intelligence. Regardless of IQ, EQ or adaptability, Zhang Shuo is worse than sleepy. Talking to Zhang Shuo, Sleepy felt like an examiner was testing a student. Every word he said was trying to catch his loopholes. However, Zhang Shuo accurately stepped on Wang Sleepy&#39;s minefield every time, making Wang Sleepy furious. Furious. When I was watching it, I was thinking: Zhang Shuo needs a speaking coach to guide him when he talks to Wang Sleepy. How do you answer the question she asked to avoid lightning. Otherwise, with your IQ, you won’t be able to handle it. Everyone doesn&#39;t understand what Wang Sleepy likes about Zhang Shuo? He is not good-looking, has poor earning power, and often loses money. He is always ambitious and wants to make a lot of money. His ability to recognize people is not good either, and those who defraud him of money are all people he considers to be his friends. If he is just not handsome and has poor earning power, he can be talented, but Zhang Shuo obviously has no talent. If you don&#39;t have talent, you can be smart enough, but Zhang Shuo is obviously not smart. If he were smart enough, he wouldn&#39;t enter Sleepy&#39;s minefield one after another to make Sleepy angry. Finally, if there is nothing wrong with this man, if he is willing to give you his money, it means that he also loves you. However, Zhang Shuo&#39;s house did not have Wang Sleeping&#39;s name written on it, but Wang Sleeping was required to repay the loan together (the two did not obtain the certificate). Zhang Shuo is not handsome, motivated, smart, and has no money. What does Wang Sleepy like about him? Just like Fu Seoul said: As long as you guys are arguing like this, I don’t think you need to go on the show to separate, we can just separate offline. But there is no point in sleeping. Not only was there no score, she was still wavering in the last two days as to whether or not to get off the train. The first ten days were divorce by choice. On the last day, just because Zhang Shuo accompanied her down the mountain to use the toilet, she chose &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; on the answer sheet. She was shaken. Wang sleeps so well. She doesn&#39;t want much, she just needs Zhang Shuo to be nice to her. This kind of kindness is actually very cheap, such as cleaning her shoes, picking up food for her when eating, putting sunscreen on her when going out, bringing sunscreen spray, and accompanying her to the toilet when she wants to go down the mountain in the middle of the night. It&#39;s enough to care about her in every detail in life, give her a sense of ritual during festivals, and send her flowers. It feels like what she needs is a life assistant, not a lover. Her requirements for her significant other are somewhat similar to our requirements for a nanny. Someone who is evenly matched with her is unlikely to be willing to be her life assistant all the time, and is unlikely to serve her front and back. Zhang Shuo, whose IQ, EQ, appearance and work ability are far inferior to hers, can serve him in every detail. He once relied on this kind of front-and-back service (what Wang Sleepy thought was &quot;good&quot;) to catch up with Wang Sleeping, but now he has taken back part of this &quot;goodness&quot;, so this is the source of their conflict. As long as Zhang Shuo returns to the way he was pursuing sleep before getting married, returns to that state, returns to the state where she is his world, they can continue to live happily. The harassment at the wedding was one factor that affected their relationship, but it was certainly not the entire factor. I thought about it, if it was my own wedding and my friend was harassed by the groom’s friend, I would definitely flip the table and ask him to make that person apologize immediately. If he didn’t dare, I would take his phone and call him directly. The instigator sent a message and called, demanding an apology. I will not let this matter wait for three years, and I will not let my friends become strangers to me because of this matter. The fact that Sleepy can endure it for three years shows that this matter is not unbearable enough for her to leave immediately. If Zhang Shuo doesn&#39;t solve this matter, she can always stand on the moral high ground to accuse him, and then use him to achieve a certain balance. I would venture to guess that sleeping in a family of origin means a little lack of love. Only girls who don&#39;t get love in their original family, or don&#39;t get enough love, will be attracted by the &quot;goodness&quot; from the opposite sex. Sleepy also said that the reason she married Zhang Shuo was because she thought Zhang Shuo&#39;s parents were very good. She felt that his parents were such good people, so their son should be good too. Speaking of this, I think of a friend of mine who was chased by his wife. He said that his wife was a classmate of his younger sister. She grew up in a family that valued boys over girls and did not receive much care. Once, my wife went to his house to play and saw the way their family members got along with each other. It was something she had never seen in her family of origin. She wanted to join such a family, so she chased my friend and got married to him. Got married. Marriage is a rebirth for a woman. Her love is not satisfied in her family of origin and she hopes to be satisfied in her family. Many people are like this, and I used to be like this too. I guess Wang Sleepy is like this, but of course it&#39;s just a guess. If this guess is true, it is not difficult to understand why Wang Sleepy is so hard-spoken and soft-hearted, and cannot do without Zhang Shuo. Just like in today&#39;s 36 questions, although she was heartbroken, what she said while crying in the car was: I thought I could reunite with him today, why did I mess everything up again? In her heart she didn&#39;t want to separate. So another question: Does Zhang Shuo love Wang Shuisue? In the show, Papi Jiang said that it felt like Zhang Shuo didn&#39;t love Wang Sleepy. I think Zhang Shuo doesn&#39;t understand love at all. He is 30 years old and thinks of himself as a boy all day long. We have all gone through the stage of youth and ignorance, and children&#39;s love is like playing house. Therefore, Zhang Shuo&#39;s understanding of love is still at the stage of a high school student: treat her well, listen to her orders, listen to her words, and give her some food, that is loving her. He chased her until she fell asleep, just like a child who saved up enough pocket money to buy an expensive piece of art. One day he found that he had accidentally broken the artwork. He panicked because he might never buy the same piece of art again, so he wanted to glue the piece of art back together. But the process of gluing the artwork was very trivial. He was a little impatient but had to do it. Maybe he won&#39;t understand until the artwork is completely damaged by him during the gluing process. Some things can&#39;t be repaired if they&#39;re broken, and some people don&#39;t have them anymore once they&#39;re lost. Zhang Shuo&#39;s growth may come after losing Wang Sleepy. Will Wang Sleeping leave Zhang Shuo? I&#39;m not sure. Just like her relationship with Zhang Shuo, she actually had big problems herself, asking questions aggressively. Zhang Shuo looked like a primary school student who couldn&#39;t answer questions in front of her. The more he was afraid of making mistakes, the more mistakes he would make. Is it a big deal to ask before giving a gift? To us adults, this is nothing. Because he was worried that if he sent it to the wrong person and you said he had bad taste, he wanted to ask. But from Wang Sleeping&#39;s point of view, she felt humiliated by having to ask her before giving gifts. Sleep also needs to grow up. When one day, she no longer appears as a superior in relationships, and her standard for measuring relationships is no longer based on whether the other person is good enough for her, she may have matured. . But growth comes at a cost. Giving up the relationships of the past ten years and the sunk costs of the past ten years require the courage to cut through the mess quickly. I wish Sleepy had such courage. Hide d",523,-0.0541212256938948,8,11,508,100.0,0,2,246.5,9357.5,1,0,0.5,88.1842,3.0,13.5,-0.1005,0.5,1.0,31,72,3

I found that you are very sexist and have a vicious male-hating mentality. I don’t know why you are so male-hating. I’ve made several quotes out of context. Sexist stereotypes about male and female differences. Men now reject stereotypes and do not say sexist things about women such as men having higher IQs than women. Women also reject stereotypes with double standards. For example, they will definitely recognize this if it is beneficial to them. But they also like stereotypes and sexism, saying that men’s empathy is not as strong as women’s. And you always use sexist stereotypes, and women are better than men.

Suddenly, the father-in-law, who had drunk too much, picked up the daughter-in-law next to him. After putting her daughter-in-law down, she still hugged her waist. The mother-in-law next to her suddenly turned green. Got it! Netizen: Never let father-in-law and daughter-in-law be alone! Guo Xiaosong&#39;s hometown is a quiet and ancient town, surrounded by green mountains and gurgling rivers. The people here are old-fashioned and traditional, and marriage is still an extremely important matter for many families. Guo Xiaosong, an ordinary and slightly dull young man, at the age of 28, under the supervision of his family, began a blind date journey for a long-awaited lifelong event. Xiaosong&#39;s mother ran around for his marriage, looking for a suitable girl for him again and again. However, Xiaosong&#39;s dullness and poor words prevented him from impressing several girls after meeting them. Until one day, he met Zhang Yuting. Yuting&#39;s beautiful appearance and slender figure made Xiaosong excited. When they met for the first time, Yuting&#39;s generosity and initiative made him feel an unprecedented sense of comfort. The two had a pleasant exchange and left each other&#39;s contact information. Not long after, Yuting came to Xiaosong&#39;s house as a guest and explored Xiaosong&#39;s life and family. Although Xiaosong&#39;s family background is solid, his introversion and ordinary appearance make Yuting more interested in him. The luxurious decoration of Xiaomatsu&#39;s home also makes her look forward to the future. As a result, the relationship between the two quickly heated up and they reached the point of discussing marriage. The day of the engagement party finally arrived. On this day, the home was decorated with joy and lanterns were hung high. Xiaosong&#39;s father, Lao Guo, is a middle-aged man who looks ordinary but has a delicate mind. He is particularly concerned about his son&#39;s marriage. At the banquet, Lao Guo&#39;s concern for his daughter-in-law was beyond ordinary. A pair of eyes stared directly at the daughter-in-law, seeming to have an unspeakable meaning. As the banquet progressed, Lao Guo gradually became a little tipsy. He stood in front of every table, his tipsy smile revealing happiness and satisfaction. Friends congratulated him on getting a virtuous and beautiful daughter-in-law. When Lao Guo heard the compliment, he was immediately elated. However, what happened next made the entire banquet instantly quiet. After congratulating her, an old friend suddenly said to Lao Guo: &quot;Congratulations, Lao Guo, you have a virtuous and beautiful daughter-in-law!&quot; Lao Guo couldn&#39;t help but smile triumphantly when he heard his friend&#39;s compliment. Then, he walked to his daughter-in-law Yuting without hesitation. Yu Ting stood aside, wearing a gorgeous cheongsam showing her graceful figure. Lao Guo&#39;s smile became even brighter, and he suddenly hugged Yu Ting. Yu Ting did not signal resistance, but swayed her cheongsam sensibly. This sudden scene stunned everyone present. Lao Guo hugged his daughter-in-law and said to everyone with a smile: &quot;We... have a custom... that is, the father-in-law wants to carry his daughter-in-law into the house... I will give it a try today...&quot; For a moment, everyone was surprised and embarrassed. , the scene was silent. The sudden action shocked everyone, and the scene was extremely embarrassing. A blush appeared on Yuting&#39;s face, but out of respect for her elders, she did not show displeasure and just lowered her head shyly. The mother-in-law next to her was even more flushed, with dissatisfaction and embarrassment flashing in her eyes. But it was difficult for her to have an attack in front of so many guests. Lao Guo seemed to be completely unaware, his smile was still bright, and he never put down the wine glass in his hand. He held Yu Ting high and maintained an intimate posture. Everyone&#39;s eyes turned to the bride and groom, and the atmosphere of the wedding was instantly broken by this unexpected scene. However, Lao Guo did not stop because of this, and still held his daughter-in-law&#39;s waist. It was not until others reminded him that Lao Guo put down his hand, but looked at Yu Ting with happiness on his face. The whole scene fell into an eerie silence, followed by applause. People applauded, perhaps surprised by this sudden move, or cheering for the happiness of the newlyweds. The wedding continued, but Lao Guo&#39;s performance became the focus of the day and was talked about by people. A guest at the scene recorded a video of this scene and posted it online, which immediately aroused heated discussion. Some netizens said, It doesn’t matter if there is no such father-in-law. Is this making other people laugh? Where is my son? Where is your mother-in-law? No matter what the reason is, I will never agree to hug you! Some netizens said that the father-in-law was trying to be a gangster by drinking, so why didn&#39;t so many women hug him and try to get one step ahead of him? Some netizens expressed their understanding and thought that this was no problem. It was a happy wedding and just a joke, and my father-in-law would not be like this normally. First of all, from an emotional and moral perspective, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior was obviously inappropriate. Although in Chinese culture, there are no strict boundaries between father-in-law and daughter-in-law. But on this occasion, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior obviously violated the generally accepted moral norms of society, that is, appropriate distance and respect should be maintained between father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Secondly, from a legal perspective, although Lao Guo&#39;s behavior may not constitute a crime. However, his behavior may be considered obscene or sexual harassment. In addition, from a legal perspective, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior while drunk may involve issues of legal liability. If Lao Guo loses his normal ability to judge and control due to drunkenness, his legal liability may be reduced. However, this needs to be based on specific legal provisions and court judgment. Specifically, the &quot;Women&#39;s Rights and Interests Protection Law&quot; stipulates: &quot;It is prohibited to sexually harass women against their will through words, texts, images, physical behaviors, etc.&quot; If Lao Guo&#39;s behavior is determined to be sexual harassment, he may face Administrative penalties or civil compensation. According to Article 3 of the Supreme Court&#39;s &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Cases of Crimes of Obstructing Marriage and Family&quot;, it is also clearly stipulated that acts that infringe on the physical dignity of others that occur at other people&#39;s weddings may constitute crimes of impeding marriage and family. In short, the customary behavior of &quot;carrying the daughter-in-law into the house&quot; is very inappropriate and disrespectful of the bride&#39;s dignity. What do you think about this?

She is very able to endure hardships, and conceptually she seems to think this is what she should be doing. As time passed, I became numb.

The content is 500 words long. 12345678910 I read the demining matters carefully before buying it. I know everything about female competition, male superiority and female inferiority, virginity complex, etc. , so this repo does not cover these. All I can say is that they are all true, and they are quite lengthy. The current progress is that all Jiao and Ji lines have been passed, and Tang Hong has passed half of them. Official repo: 1.CG collapse. The most unacceptable point. I played the demo in advance and decided to buy it because the OP, vertical painting and the first CG were very beautiful. After actually playing it, I found that this was the beauty. As the main game of Jiaoxian, there is a lot of CG, but almost all of it is broken. The male protagonist’s face is broken, the female protagonist is bald, and the picture is rough. The CG quality of Ji Xian and Tang Hongxian is better, but the exquisiteness cannot be compared with the vertical painting OP, and the quantity is also smaller. 2. The content of Xiongjing differs from expectations. I thought it was because the male protagonists were constantly vying for the female protagonist&#39;s favor with their peacock feathers. They were fighting openly and secretly with each other&#39;s tea skills and martial arts. The female protagonist was swaying from side to side and made mistakes that all women in the world would make. The reality is that the male protagonists are in love and competing for the female protagonist&#39;s body, and the female protagonist is like a floating duck in the wind. Both her inner and outer body are hurt. Hime Line has some tea art teasing scenes, but they are very short. 3. Sexual harassment has reached the level of sexual assault. As mentioned above, I read the demining before buying it and was mentally prepared for sexual harassment, but the severity was higher than expected. Things that the male protagonist did to the female protagonist include forced tongue kissing, licking, stripping off clothes, rubbing breasts, (in public) touching the lower body with hands and borderline sexual intercourse, and (for those who did not reach the last step) raping. The heroine was not at all happy, and she resisted being scared throughout the whole process. Any heroine who is a little happy can be regarded as a side interest, but unfortunately there is no such thing. The Jiao line has mutually consensual edges and is not included. There may be players who are good at this, but not me. 4. The length is really short.
