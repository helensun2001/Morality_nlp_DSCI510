0,"[Media Comment:] Hello, welcome to &quot;Feng Ping&quot;. The incident of a Rottweiler dog biting a two-year-old girl in Chengdu has sparked controversy and heated discussion that continues to rage. Nowadays, many communities have begun to search for puppies running around and arrest them when they see them. There are also many media carrying machines to do live broadcasts, which is very lively. In this way, dog lovers say, &quot;Dogs are mankind&#39;s loyal friends, and you cannot beat all dogs to death just because of one dog.&quot; Friends who are opposed to dog raising also say, &quot;Freedom has boundaries, and your hobbies cannot &quot;Become a burden to others&quot;, &quot;From now on, all aggressive dogs walking without leashes will be punished&quot;, &quot;If you don&#39;t lock up the dogs, lock up the people&quot;.

2,"Why do I particularly hate uncivilized dog walking? Because it’s really annoying. Stray dogs don’t keep their leashes because they don’t have owners. So why don’t dogs with owners keep their leashes? They’re not stray dogs, but they’re just bastards. But whether it is a teddy or a dog larger than a teddy, it should be kept on a loose leash. It is not without an owner, right? It is not a stray dog, right? You can&#39;t always use &quot;it won&#39;t bite&quot; to morally kidnap anyone. After all, there are still many people who are afraid of dogs, and dogs are uncertain, and they may start biting people at some point. Not every owner can educate his dog well, because people are different. If that person hears grandma&#39;s &quot;reminder&quot; and takes the seat, and comes to find trouble with me, I&#39;m not afraid, because I&#39;m not talking about him, I&#39;m talking about all the people who walk their dogs without a leash. If they insist on taking the seat, there&#39;s nothing I can do. After all, It is true that he walks the dog without a leash, and it is normal for him to take it in automatically, but he cannot say that there is something wrong with what I said, and it cannot lead to a vicious quarrel or the like. Anyway, people who walk their dogs in an uncivilized manner are just annoying. And I don’t want any dog to cause trouble or even injury or death to other people because the owner does not hold the leash, and then all kinds of messy things. So I hope that if you own a dog, you must be responsible for the dog, walk the dog with a tight leash, and be responsible for yourself. The dog is responsible, and he is also responsible for other passers-by.

9,"I think the illegal cost of keeping a dog should be increased. There are many cases where dogs run away after causing trouble, and the owners do not take responsibility at all. At this time, if the victim&#39;s injury is relatively minor, our country&#39;s grassroots police force may not be enough to find the dog owner and then bring the victim to the door to ask for compensation. Even if the dog owner can be found, what can the victim do if the dog owner refuses to pay compensation? &quot;There must be a mistake, my dog does not bite people.&quot; They all say that dog owners should be severely punished. If a dog bites you, you only need to get a rabies vaccine. For this kind of injury, there are not enough laws to even detain the dog owner, and the grassroots law enforcement forces do not have the energy to enforce it for such a small amount of money. Dog owner compensation. Grassroots governance is too complicated. All requirements to deal with people increase the cost of law enforcement. Faced with the difficulty of claiming compensation after an accident, I think the simplest way to prevent it is to treat unleashed dogs as stray dogs and hunt them, which will increase the illegal costs of dog owners. So now I face any content that only calls for punishment of dog owners and does not mention how the dogs should be treated. They are regarded as attempts to increase the cost of grassroots law enforcement and prevent the management of dogs.

15,"Record: Yesterday I posted an analysis on the psychology of dog biting in the owner group and was scolded. I personally like well-behaved puppies, but I am a little scared when I see a dog without a leash. One day I was riding in the elevator and saw a closed There was an owner with his puppy in the elevator. He didn&#39;t dare to sit on it without a leash, so he decided to take the next elevator. But I didn&#39;t estimate the time. When the elevator opened, the dog owner was still inside. The dog owner was very unhappy and started to blame me. This caused a shadow in my mind. After I was scolded that day, I spoke for the first time in the owner group, told my story, and suggested that everyone keep their dogs on leashes. I said it several times, but no one paid any attention to me. That day, in order to vent my emotions, I changed the group nickname to &quot;Walking a dog without a leash is equivalent to walking a dog&quot; (an online jingle). Until the recent incidents of dogs hurting people, everyone was paying attention to stray dogs, and some people said that it was true. I also support keeping dogs on leashes. Yesterday I saw a video on Station B. It was an up owner who patiently analyzed the dog&#39;s psychology starting from a puppy biting video and taught us how to respect and love dogs. I think it is particularly useful. I have never hated dogs. What I hate the most is scoundrels who walk their dogs without leashes. So I shared this video to the owner group, hoping it would help others. After that I went about my own business. As a result, I was watching the group this morning and found that an owner was scolding me in the group, saying that I was &quot;endless, 💩eating too much&quot;, and her nickname was also changed to a sentence that scolded me. I took a look at her signature and it read, &quot;A dog is always a dog, and a human is not necessarily a human being.&quot; (Apart from the aspect directed at me, this is what she said.) I would also be angry, but I think she might not be a human at all. I didn’t look carefully at what I was sharing, and started scolding me just by looking at the title. Then he replied: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, have you watched the video I shared in full? The whole video is about analyzing how to treat puppies better through case studies. My nickname is just for some uncivilized dogs who walk without leash. The scoundrels on the rope have never had any opinions on puppies, and they only target irresponsible dog owners. The puppies are punished because of the owner&#39;s irresponsibility. I see that your signature is also a dog lover, and I don&#39;t want to quarrel with you. . Or are you right? Are you the one who walks the dog without a leash? I don’t think so.” After that, I felt that the nickname was not very good.

19,"What is the relationship between pets and people? It&#39;s very simple. Pets are essentially commodities that people buy, just like cars and appliances, or to put it more bluntly, just like toys. When people buy pets, pets provide emotional value, a channel for emotional sustenance, and emotional comfort; and pets get three meals a day, a place to shelter from wind and rain, and are protected by their owners from natural enemies. danger. Fair dealing, everyone gets what he needs. In fact, the relationship is that simple. Cars, electrical appliances, and toys are produced on factory assembly lines and are sold as commodities; pets are also bred in specialized pet breeding bases and are bred for the purpose of being sold as commodities. When people find that cars, electrical appliances, and toys have been used for a long time and have various problems and they no longer want to use them, they can be sold as second-hand goods or sent to scrap recycling stations as scrap. The same goes for pets. Similarly, discarding cars, electrical appliances, and toys at will will have an impact on the surrounding environment and cannot be discarded at will. Since pets are alive, they can walk, run, bite, and poop everywhere, so discarding pets at will has a greater impact; what should we do? Woolen cloth? It&#39;s very simple, just like commodities, establish a second-hand pet market to trade second-hand pets, and establish a pet recycling station to slaughter pets. This is the optimal solution for society. Pets are bred from breeding bases and sold as commodities. It is estimated that millions of pet dogs are bred across the country every year. There are actually calls for the establishment of shelters for stray dogs. If such an institution is really established, it will really generate income for the pet dog breeding and breeding base. Those who shout to protect pets, those who stop dog-selling trucks to rescue pet dogs, if they can spend their own money to build a zoo for the rescued pet dogs, provide three meals a day, and show their love, then there is no need any problem. But if you are just responsible for the rescue, regardless of the follow-up, it is actually a selfish behavior. You gain moral satisfaction and desire for expression, while leaving the responsibility and cost to others in society.

20,"The wait is finally here! CCTV speaks out for stray cats and dogs, and the views of legal experts are even more surprising: one dog is wrong, and thousands of dogs and cats pay the bill. After the Rottweiler incident in Chongzhou, Chengdu, too many innocent stray animals have died on the streets. Some of them were injured by residents in the community, and some were killed by security guards for the safety of residents. In short, their deaths should not have been such an accident. As time passed, we finally waited for CCTV’s announcement! This time, CCTV also spoke for stray cats and dogs! Is it the human&#39;s fault or the dog&#39;s? Looking back at the original Rottweiler biting incident, you will find that if you want to prevent the incident from happening, you only need one key person, which is the dog&#39;s owner. If the offending dog is led by a leash when going out, it is supervised by its owner. , presumably it cannot hurt the child no matter what. Unfortunately, the dog was not leashed and the owner did not surrender until early in the morning, so it was too late. The first responsible party in this matter is the dog, but the specific responsible person behind this responsible party is the owner of the dog. It is precisely for this reason that after the incident happened, the girl’s family will hold the other party responsible, and the dog owner will also Forced to surrender. Why shouldn’t people pay for their faults? CCTV’s views have also been supported by many experts and scholars. A law professor at a university even bluntly said that protecting animals is actually protecting people. A law professor is obviously an expert in his professional field. Why does he have such surprising views? I think maybe it&#39;s because this professor understands the essence of the matter. Many times, people deal with cats and dogs vigorously and resolutely, not because they are speaking out for justice, but to satisfy their own inner desires. People use this behavior to vent their emotions, thinking that stray animals will not speak for themselves, and we do not need to pay a price or bear any responsibility for any of our actions. But if such atrocities continue unchecked, then when one day those who harm animals are no longer satisfied with harming animals, where will they turn their attention? I think it is precisely with this in mind that law professors come up with the idea that protecting animals means protecting people. A professor at Tsinghua University also pointed out that human behavior is the main cause of stray dogs. This point of view summarizes many facts, which are actually deliberately ignored by some people. Some people treat cats and dogs as pets. They buy them with money and throw them away when they don&#39;t like them. There are more and more stray animals in the city, but why don&#39;t we think about why there are so many stray animals in the city? What did these stray animals go through before they became stray animals? Some netizens mentioned the disposal of animals abroad. Every pet owner has a responsibility for his or her pet. If a pet is abandoned, the pet owner must bear the responsibility. This responsibility is specific and will make them Don’t dare abandon your pets easily. With punishment, there will be fewer and fewer abandoned animals, and the number of stray animals will not be able to grow so fast. In the final analysis, solving the root cause of stray animals is not about dealing with the animals, but to prevent such behavior from happening again. This is reasonable and controllable. This time, CCTV has spoken out, as have university professors, experts and scholars. I wonder if these wise and rational remarks can make people who are trapped in emotions completely wake up and seriously think about the nature of this issue?

22,"The incident of a Chengdu girl being bitten by a vicious dog is very distressing. In the final analysis, it is still a human problem. Behind countless dog troubles, they are the result of man-made disasters. Dog problems are essentially human problems. Vicious dogs hurt people, and the root cause of the problem is that the dog takes the blame. Dogs don’t understand human affairs, but people understand human affairs. If something goes wrong, the person must be responsible, right? The reason why there are so many stray dogs now is that dog owners just abandon them on a whim based on temporary interest. Over time, the dogs cause a lot of inconvenience and they are abandoned at will. As a result, there are more and more stray dogs, wild dogs form groups, and their wildness gradually becomes apparent. Emerge. In fact, this is nothing. Some dog owners are really not as good as dogs. They don’t clean up their dog’s feces, walk their dogs without leashing them, and let their dogs bark and run around. Not everyone is not afraid of dogs. If he reprimands his dog, he will immediately get angry and speak dirty words. The key point is that some people&#39;s dogs bite others, and they ask others, why did you mess with my dog, and insist that it was the fault of the person who bitten, and their hearts have become bad, and it is difficult to recover. I think it’s not the dog’s problem, it’s the people’s problem. It’s the people who harm the dogs. If you really love dogs, don&#39;t cause trouble to others. This is the best protection for dogs.

28,"Personally, I think there is absolutely no need to solicit donations unless it is absolutely necessary, and returning them is necessary. However, we support the girl’s family to claim compensation from the dog owner. The dog owner must fully compensate for the medical expenses and all subsequent treatment and recovery costs, and promise to compensate the girl at any time if she develops related health problems in the future. At the same time, vicious dogs that bite must be beaten to death. If euthanasia is not convenient, the same can be done by beating them to death with sticks and stones, or strangulating them with a rope. Even if time could be turned back, no matter what the girl or her parents did, there is no reason to punish her with a dog. The dog bit someone viciously, causing serious consequences. The dog and its owner must bear responsibility. Nowadays, it is not the problem of a dog biting a person that leads to the wholesale eradication of stray dogs. It is the result of ordinary people being bitten and killed by dogs for a long time. There are a large number of victims every year, and everyone is intolerable. This is not a dog, but a group of dogs. If you really want to have a frank discussion, there is no need to secretly change the concept. This is not a matter of one-size-fits-all lazy politics. On the premise that there is no better way to deal with stray dogs and manage dog breeding normally, the necessary one-size-fits-all approach is to be responsible for the safety of the people and the next victim. If you do nothing because you are afraid of being told that one size fits all, that is truly lazy politics. The key is that there has never been a one-size-fits-all approach, not now, nor in the past. Dogs raised normally are fine, and dogs running around without a leash are fine. There are many stray dogs encountered these days. In the final analysis, it is not one-size-fits-all, but one-size-fits-all. It&#39;s not cut, that&#39;s the big problem.

30,"How to control stray dogs has become the most urgent social security issue in the safest country in the world. So, how to control the problem of stray dogs? This has to be said about Germany. The Germans&#39; regulations on raising dogs are really strict and are engraved in the hearts of Germans. Let China copy it, there is indeed something worth learning from capitalism. Here’s a summary of some of the rules for raising dogs in Germany: 1. Keeping a dog requires the consent of your neighbors. When raising a dog in Germany, you must first obtain the consent of your neighbors and ensure that it will not affect their lives. You can&#39;t let your dog urinate randomly, and you can&#39;t let your dog bark at home and disturb your neighbors&#39; rest. If you violate these regulations, you may be subject to fines or other penalties. 2. Dog owners and dogs must go to dog school. It costs 50 euros per hour to raise a dog in Germany. After your neighbor agrees, you have to take your puppy to dog school, from kindergarten to junior high school, and then the high school graduation exam. You and you Only when dogs get their diplomas can they enter society. 3. You have to pay tax for raising a dog. You have to pay it every year. Taking Berlin as an example, you need to pay 120 euros in tax every year to raise the first dog, and you have to pay another 180 euros to raise the second dog. If you keep a dog secretly without paying taxes, If found, a fine of 10,000 euros will be imposed. 4. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs with a compensation of no less than 1 million euros. Under normal circumstances, German dog owners need to pay an annual insurance premium of 75 to 270 euros for their dogs, and dangerous dogs have to pay more than 30% more premiums. 5. Dog owners must spend enough time with their dogs. When raising a dog in Germany, dog owners need to spend a certain amount of time with their dogs. For example, owners should take their dogs with them when they go out, and they cannot leave their dogs at home alone for more than 3 hours. If you do not walk your dog for a long time, someone will complain to an animal protection organization. The charge is that you torture small animals. 6. Dog owners are fined 90,000 euros for abandoning dogs. German law stipulates that anyone who abandons a dog (including those who move and leaves the dog in the same place) must be fined 90,000 euros and may be imprisoned for 3 years. 7. A chip must be implanted and you must pay for it at your own expense. According to the European Union, all pets (cats, dogs, and minks) must have an ID number. There are two options: one is to tattoo the number on a conspicuous part of the pet&#39;s skin; the other is to implant it under the skin. Enter the microchip. 8. Adoption costs money. In Germany, adoption is not free. For example, in Berlin, the cost of adopting a dog is generally 205 euros. 9. Documents are required. The pet’s identity certificate and health certificate are essential! 10. Dogs are not allowed to enter some public places. Dogs are strictly prohibited from entering children&#39;s playgrounds, leisure lawns, swimming pools and other places marked &quot;Dogs are not allowed&quot;. Anyone who fails to supervise dogs in public places will be fined 10,000 euros. 11. Feeding stray dogs is deemed as having custody. If a stray dog bites someone, the person who feeds it will be responsible for compensation. 12. Stray dogs that are not adopted are killed. In Germany, stray dogs captured by the government are killed if no one pays to adopt them within ten days. Therefore, there are no stray dogs on the streets in Germany now...",282,-0.146187922126562,5,8,277,22,3,0,1,0,7,0,100.0,"[0.8910113779642612, 0.9909166169700678, 0.5262327818078083, 0.8900641299176263, 0.8523081305489806, 0.9631598667765927, 0.6366326395620691, 0.9789393784839117, 0.7140166799033807, 0.9603293623226896, 0.9777109609445176, 0.9563024306917733, 0.7033178254417964, 0.11387707852327922, 0.028436267774010315, 0.3622474078675685, 0.7114668320519203, 0.5, 0.15468106262552628, 0.3032381672850657, 0.9019076908332154, 0.6753115079485625, 0.5941099740413435, 0.7894736842105263, 0.5084745762711864, 0.9674853146939328, 0.7517302947245337, 0.7135554914350883, 0.07071261635641546, 0.8228297437694443, 0.060449377533473236, 0.07828747929353597, 0.0661125300446217, 0.7561374221659736, 0.02924687338417764, 0.37272377320493444, 0.4193222776805414, 0.014825978119243466, 0.9997605370286398, 0.9617732497005068, 0.7059350910838099, 0.5478741204270207, 0.8195040647040582, 0.6874988643665801, 0.942449825946794, 0.9951317781575649, 0.3308859893538123, 0.4345556858057015, 0.2873548678519715, 0.7465407407875234, 0.9994412326610046, 0.7025809910184717, 0.2815530642615157, 0.45199945494106586, 0.7499999999999999, 0.03383747340132515, 0.016674151946352023, 0.6217911943028528, 0.1970062871284325, 0.43106891477771114, 0.9881808371713919, 0.9286838541970016, 0.05023754210999498, 0.9297038117696982, 0.9924408454872258, 0.2994615495953691, 0.5, 0.5262327818078083, 0.9873409650628913]"

32,"I think the most effective way to deal with stray dogs and dog walkers letting aggressive dogs loose without leashes is not to achieve the goal by banning aggressive dogs. First of all, how do stray dogs come into being? Most of them are abandoned by irresponsible people. If effective management regulations are not introduced to prohibit random abandonment, there will never be a way to prevent the occurrence of stray dogs. If you are like some countries where you have to pay a large fine for abandoning a pet dog, you will see how many people dare to abandon it at will. Not getting a dog license for large dogs is not the best way to prevent dogs from biting people. Will puppies stop biting people? Some large dogs are more docile than small dogs and are banned from breeding if they are messed with. What usually happens when a dog bites someone is when the owner is irresponsible and does not keep the dog on a leash. Instead of going to the door to catch the dog that cannot get a dog license, it is better not to introduce rigid regulations to stipulate that dogs must be leashed when walking. Dog leashes must also be muzzled. Find some uncles and aunties who patrol every day and fine anyone who doesn&#39;t have a rope tied up. Look at who dares not to tie up a rope. (In the future, no one likes to have children, and more and more people will keep pets. This part of the fine can also become an income-generating project.) Instead of not applying for dog licenses for aggressive dogs and letting these high-risk dog breeds become black households, it is better to take the initiative to give aggressive dogs Dogs must apply for dog certificates, have mandatory chip implantation, and return visits every year, allowing families of aggressive dogs to take responsibility for caring for aggressive dogs. In this way, whenever a dog bites a person or an owner abandons a aggressive dog, each aggressive dog can be traced back to its source with a chip identification, allowing the owner to To shoulder the responsibility of caring for dogs, only some unreliable owners will really take care of them and dare not let them roam free and abandon them. There are often better solutions to many things, but one-size-fits-all is counterproductive. People have been raising many banned dog breeds for many years. Now that you are saying that they are no longer allowed to be raised, how will they be disposed of and thrown out? Then the dogs thrown out continued to expand the stray dog population. Can you catch all the stray dogs? Well, even if we vigorously arrest and deal with all the stray dogs in the city, then after this period of time, no one will abandon them for adoption?

The little girls in Chengdu were bitten like that, but they were not seen in a hurry and came out to condemn the unscrupulous dog owner. It is really a great irony that a group that even requires national legislation to restrict the use of leashes for walking dogs shamelessly talks about civilization and love on the Internet. You should hold on to the dog leash in your hands, that is true civilization, and that is true love for the dogs you raise. Don’t the so-called dog lovers want to learn from Western legislation to protect small animals? Let’s take a look at the dog-raising regulations in Germany first! 1. When raising a dog in Germany, you must first obtain the consent of your neighbors and ensure that it will not affect their lives. Can you do that for those dog fans who don’t even tie up a leash or even shovel dog poop? . 2. In addition to implanting a microchip into the dog, you also need to ensure that your yard meets the breeding requirements. The microchip fee is 1,600 yuan, which is paid by the dog owner. Can you do it? 3. It is necessary to purchase third-party insurance. You need to pay 6,700 yuan for a large dog and 1,700 yuan for a small dog. Can dog fans do it? 4. If you abandon your own dog, you will be fined 100,000 yuan or imprisoned for three years. If it is strictly enforced, will there still be stray dogs? 5. If the dog urinates outdoors or receives complaints from neighbors, the dog owner will be severely punished. 6. If a dog hurts a person, depending on the severity of the situation, the dog owner may not only be sentenced to jail, but may also be subject to property damage. Compared with foreign countries, the laws and regulations governing dog breeding in our country are too benevolent, and the law enforcement and management are too weak. It&#39;s not too late to make amends. Faced with the predicament that the dog epidemic in our country is becoming more and more chaotic as time goes by, the first thing is to do a good job in legislation. Stones from other mountains can be used to attack jade, and we can completely copy Germany&#39;s regulations. The second is to do a good job in law enforcement. With laws as strict as those in Germany, it is even more necessary to have a strict law enforcement team and a normalized management mechanism. We must severely punish hypocritical dog fans who abandon dogs and lead to stray dogs everywhere.

34,"The most annoying thing I encountered was walking my dog without a leash. A big dog pounced on you and wanted to get close to you. Its owner also said that my dog does not bite. I want to say that not biting is the key point. The key point is whether I am afraid of dogs or not. Even if they don’t bite me, I will be scared... I’m really speechless. As for stray dogs, I think they should be allowed to fend for themselves and not be fed. If you raise them and strengthen their breeding capabilities, they can add countless stray dogs to the neighborhood. Who will be responsible for the countless uncertain factors that will be added to society at that time? The person who feeds it will definitely not be responsible, and he will not be able to care about the dog&#39;s descendants. (Even if the dog you feed doesn’t bite, what about its offspring?)

35,"I don’t know if you still remember, but there was once a case involving a charity girl who specialized in adopting stray animals. For this reason, she voluntarily spent time, energy and financial resources to collect stray cats and dogs, deworm them, vaccinate them, dress them up as beautifully as possible, and then find them for adoption through various channels. According to local laws and regulations, stray cats and dogs that have not been adopted out for more than 12 days are considered ownerless animals and must be disposed of harmlessly. So she could only euthanize the overdue cats and dogs with tears in her eyes... She used her enthusiasm and kindness to save thousands of stray animals. However, in the end, she was forced to death by a group of extreme animal rights activists... Extreme feminism, extreme Animal protection, extreme environmental protection and spicy crispy people are the same kind of people. I believe that most of us are incompatible with them in this life... We all know that human nature is divided into good and evil. The distinction between good people and bad people is based on what they do. Bad people will be punished for doing bad things. This is true in the human world and also in the animal world. A dog that bites people for no reason in public places is obviously not a good dog. Some people say that dogs are meant to bite. This is their nature. It seems reasonable at first glance, but if you think about it carefully, you will understand that it will only react strongly when strangers invade its home (the owner&#39;s home). Or, when a stranger violates its owner with force, some of them will act to protect the owner. They generally do not behave this way in public places. Therefore, it is an unforgivable crime for a dog to bite a passerby in a public place for no reason... It is said that dogs follow human nature, and dogs will be trained by people. The ancients have long experienced this, which is called dogs relying on human power. In ancient books, domestic dogs that describe ruffians and bullies are often described as evil dogs. This is the truth...good dogs can be taught. Dogs themselves may not be good or bad, but they are taught by people to be good or bad. A well-trained dog has a docile personality, and vice versa. A few days ago, there was an entry called &quot;Stray dogs don&#39;t think they are wandering.&quot; Dogs really don&#39;t understand what straying is, but people do. We don’t need to know what the dog feels. We need to be clear about what we feel. Similar entries include &quot;I have saved your kind, can we let ours go?&quot;, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with stray dogs&quot;, etc. On the surface, these entries seem to have a strong sense of justice, but in reality they confuse right and wrong. It was like confusing good guys and bad guys, so netizens used mice to use similar words, and said that they could take as many as they wanted... I said that day that all animals have the fundamental attribute of &quot;serving&quot; humans in the history of evolution. Human history is a long history of mutual complementation and evolution between humans and animals. It seems unfair to other animals if we only label dogs as the biggest &quot;contributors&quot; to saving mankind. For example, Shedan Chuanbei Liquid, Angong Niuhuang Pills, Musk Baoxin Pills, Kangfuxin Liquid, Bear Bile Powder, Ant Lishen, etc. will express dissatisfaction. Even mice, centipedes, scorpions, deer antler, land turtles, turtles, cockroaches, and earthworms will express dissatisfaction. Talk. Falling into the rhetorical trap of &quot;animals save lives&quot; is tantamount to declaring that this problem has no solution... Besides, there is no doubt that human rights always come first. Otherwise, we should not harm all animals. They are all worthy of being in the Ancestral Temple... Human beings who stand at the top of the food chain are wise enough to use all animals on this planet according to their attributes. It can be edible, ornamental, assisting human work, etc. Since ancient times, cats and dogs, &quot;human companions&quot;, have long been &quot;assigned&quot; to the primitive jobs of &quot;looking after homes and homes&quot; and &quot;catching mice.&quot; But with the progress of the times, they no longer need to take on this kind of work, but some still continue to perform the duties of assisting humans, such as working dogs. Including search and rescue dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, drug detection dogs... They are carefully selected by humans. They spend a lot of time and energy training corresponding skills and pass a series of strict assessment and elimination mechanisms before they can finally get the corresponding assessment. Only with a certificate can you begin to undertake special tasks in serving humanity. Even if you retire in the future, there will be strict procedures. Some people deliberately confuse them with stray dogs or vicious dogs. What are their intentions? It&#39;s like saying, you = human, tramp = human, you = tramp, the same logic... Do the people who came up with these terms really don&#39;t understand? I&#39;m afraid some people are pretending to be confused and deliberately changing the concept. During the graduation season every year, campus is one of the places where stray cats and dogs appear the most. They are active and responsible in handling cats and dogs. It is very easy to use these greasy literary articles to incite these leeks to burst into tears and move themselves, just as it is easy for them to knock on the door during the epidemic... A few days ago, several celebrities were banned from Weibo for posting inappropriate remarks about stray dogs. The reason for their ban was &quot;violation of relevant laws and regulations.&quot; This is different from &quot;violating community-related regulations&quot;. The former belongs to national laws and the latter belongs to platform regulations. Since it is a violation of national law, which one is it? I also said that day that it was a rumor, or a rumor. Using the term &quot;let all dogs bear the responsibility&quot; as an analogy that all &quot;between the walls&quot; of one person must be &quot;castrated&quot; is equivalent to insinuating that there is no distinction between good and bad people in society. Comparing &quot;I have saved your kind&quot; to &quot;Please let go of our kind&quot; is equivalent to not distinguishing between good and bad dogs. To confuse right and wrong by dragging working dogs into this muddy water also means to discredit the division of labor in this society. Making the &quot;wannabe killing of stray dogs&quot; so public is suspected of smearing state public officials, which is equivalent to channeling mass conflicts into conflicts between the masses and the government. You have ulterior motives. It is self-evident who is the driving force behind these words... Regarding how society should manage stray cats and dogs, we must first understand how they came into being. Obviously, humans actively or passively &quot;create&quot; a large number of stray animals. These cute pets that should have a &quot;home&quot; have become homeless stray animals due to the irresponsibility of some people, and they pose a safety hazard to normal human life. Sooner or later, they will be included in the social governance system ’s... So, humans should naturally take responsibility to solve this problem. what to do? First of all, we need to cut off the root cause and start from the source. Don&#39;t throw it away at will. If you don&#39;t love it for three minutes, you must love it for a lifetime and be responsible to the end. The second is to solve the inventory. Rather than seeing them wandering around or being hit by cars or beaten to death or poisoned or tortured to death, it is better to euthanasia. Of course, the best way is to adopt. You can adopt individually or from a shelter. Many non-governmental organizations and individuals have a certain capacity to adopt, but it is very small. After all, the volume is huge. Relying on private adoption cannot solve the fundamental problem, and the government must take the lead to solve it. On the one hand, the government can provide funds to build shelters, and on the other hand, it can legislate strict restrictions on dog owners and clearly define the responsibilities and obligations of dog owners. In our country, the threshold for raising pets is low and the control is loose. There are some people with low quality who get involved and ruin the reputation. However, the mainstream cannot be messed up, otherwise it is not impossible to raise the threshold through legislation in the future. Judging from the experience of developed countries, it is very likely that euthanasia will be the solution for stray animals in the future. We must be aware of it... As a true dog lover, what we have to do is not to fight against other groups and create more conflicts. , but to do what you should do. Major media, including CCTV, have been advocating civilized dog raising for how many years. How many times have they been told about tying a leash to pick up poop? Has any effect been achieved? Very little. Even as a dog owner, sometimes I can’t help but want to curse someone, let alone other people, when I suddenly step on a piece of dog poop while walking on the road. Ordinarily, if we can&#39;t do just this little thing well, how can we still have the nerve to blame others for scolding us? The day when dog lovers can truly feel proud is when they gain the favor and recognition of most non-dog lovers. Striving to gain their recognition and approval and to reflect the qualities we should have should become our broad internal consensus and goal. Because only if everyone raises dogs in a civilized manner is the only way to break through the long-standing estrangement between groups and respect each other. There is no other way. We are just one of many groups, and there is no reason for others to accommodate us unconditionally. If groups want to live harmoniously, they must compromise with each other rather than confront each other... One final point. We are all responsible for the governance of society. We all hope that the environment we live in will become more and more beautiful and the society will become more harmonious. After all, no one wants to step on dog poop or be bitten by dogs in the community; no one wants to be beaten while walking the dog, or be poisoned when shopping online. Have you ever thought about what would happen if the sanitation workers did not clean up the dog feces on the ground for three to five days? By then, how many dogs will not be cured, and how many people will not be cured? Is that really good?

36,"The vicious dog bite incident in Chongzhou makes me speechless to see which celebrities show love. You know that a certain chain of interests is not easy to mess with, right? Want to know where stray dogs come from? It can almost be said that the source of stray dogs is the active abandonment of irresponsible owners. Some people say is it possible that stray dogs are lost dogs? I would say strictly that the probability is less than 1%. Why? If a dog is not abandoned by its owner, even if it is lost and cannot walk home, it is fine to walk near its own community. Secondly, if you keep a dog on a leash when you go out, how can it get lost if the leash never leaves your hand? Therefore, the core problem of stray dogs is the abandonment of the dog owner and the negligence of not having a leash, resulting in the loss of the dog. What practical significance does it have to solve the superficial problem of stray dogs? Isn’t the core call for improving dog owner information, establishing relevant administrative penalties for abandoned pets, and making it mandatory to walk dogs on a leash? This can eliminate the appearance of stray dogs from the source. Why do some people get excited when mentioning stray dogs? When stray dogs disappear, the benefits of some people are gone. Every year, some of the various non-governmental organizations sincerely sympathize with the stray dogs and do practical things, but there are also some who are charitable, raise funds, line their own pockets, take kickbacks for material purchases, and blatantly take advantage of charity funds. Therefore, those celebrities who gain traffic can definitely be either stupid or bad. If you want to show your love, you can even adopt a few stray dogs. It costs 0 to say a few &quot;loving&quot; words, but actually does nothing.

38,"Regarding stray dogs, although they scolded me crazily, I will calmly say it for the last time. I have always respected civilized dog owners. I don’t like dogs myself. When I was a child, I was chased by a stray dog on the way to school, which has left a shadow on me for the rest of my life. , it is impossible to live with a dog in this life. But many of my relatives and friends have cats and dogs, and under their control I can live in peace with dogs. So although I can’t raise a dog myself, I can understand and respect it. But unmanaged dogs should be taken into custody. Dogs are always animals. It’s not surprising that they bite people. They bite people anyway. If they get out of human control, they are a huge hidden danger. Urban stray dogs are not abandoned by irresponsible people who like dogs for two days. You should not scold the people who take them in. You should scold the people who abandon them. They make the dogs homeless and out of control. Stray dogs controlled by people should be taken into custody. So I said, agree to this and let’s talk about the method. Those who come up and say &quot;dogs are higher than people&quot; and &quot;people are inferior to dogs&quot;, stay away from them. It is always people-oriented. The risk of dog bites should not be passed on to the public. This has a mass basis. The holders of this risk are only the silent majority. I still hope that the government can assume this responsibility, because if If the government transfers this power and responsibility and ignores risks but they still exist, then whoever bears the risks will take action. For example, the ham sausage incident is not only illegal, but also creates other risks. Another example is using weapons for self-defense. If everyone brings weapons when going out, social instability will suddenly increase. Therefore, the government will not leave stray dogs alone. Instead of worrying about stray dogs being caught, it is better to promote the standardized management of dog owners from the source, and introduce regulatory measures for abandoned dogs, those who are not on leashes, those who are not certified, those who are not vaccinated, those who bite people, and those who bite dogs. And punitive measures, like traffic regulations, a point deduction and fine system, compensation for those who deserve it, and penalties for those who deserve it. After the points are deducted, it is forbidden to apply for a dog license within a few years. If you keep a dog without a license, you will be fully responsible. If you bite someone because you have not been vaccinated against rabies, you will be responsible. If a person dies, he will be punished like a drunk driver. This is called standardizing dog raising. Rules without penalties are invalid. Those who cannot do it cannot raise dogs. Since stray dogs originate from dog owners, regulating dog ownership in this way can reduce stray dogs from the source. Let’s do something for stray dogs because they are pitiful.

39,"Some time ago, a stray dog here suddenly went crazy and bit people everywhere. It bit more than a dozen people in one afternoon. One person had a piece of flesh bitten off his stomach and spent 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. He needed serum injections and was hospitalized. There is no owner to turn to for compensation, so we can only admit that we are unlucky. Later, for the safety of the elderly and weak in the family, several strong men gathered together and beat the dog to death, so that the people around him dared to go out. People who are afraid of dogs are afraid of even tethered dogs, not to mention stray dogs that are left unattended and have a high probability of being sick and biting. I do not support sharks and cats and dogs. They are already very pitiful and abandoned by people, but they are indeed potential threats. Domestic cats and dogs may still bite people and they may not necessarily be vaccinated. The most outrageous sentence is &quot;It He&#39;s very well-behaved and doesn&#39;t bite.&quot; It is also unrealistic to adopt stray cats and dogs. It is obviously someone’s fault and I don’t know why the animals should be blamed. If raising a pet is the same as having a child/property, there are similar processes and procedures for registering a household registration and real estate certificate.

It is not incomprehensible for a stray dog to injure someone and then be killed. What is incomprehensible is to kill them indiscriminately. Why is it that dog ownership certificates have never been issued to all dog owners? I rarely see anyone checking for this in my home.

48,"Reposting this article by Lian Yue, I appreciate the clear logic. Human rights are greater than dog rights Original Lian Yue Lianyue 2023-10-2208:08 Hello Teacher Lian Yue: I have been following you for more than a year. I read your content every day or two. I already have the habit of checking in and reading. I really admire you. Your words contain wise analysis and suggestions, as well as full of positive energy and warm kindness. I&#39;m having a tough time myself right now and would love to hear your advice. I am 45 years old and currently a stay-at-home mother. I usually like small animals and have been feeding stray kittens outdoors for two or three years. I have a one-and-a-half-year-old Teddy dog at home. In terms of family members, I have two children. The eldest is in high school, and the second is in sixth grade in elementary school. The eldest is very proactive in his studies and does not need me to worry about it, but the second child loves to have fun and is afraid of difficulties... He is unconscious in many aspects and needs my constant reminder and supervision. The two children are as caring as me and support me in raising cats and dogs. But my husband doesn’t like animals, and he doesn’t even like the smell of dogs that occasionally emanates from a corner of the house. I tried to raise corgis and pastoral dogs before... but I was always pressured by my husband&#39;s negative emotions. The Teddy I am currently raising is one that I fought hard to keep. He has been raised for two months and is now one and a half years old. My husband had no choice but to accept it, but he never helped with all the work of taking care of the dog, such as walking the dog in the morning and evening. I didn&#39;t care before and took good care of the dog. Anyway, I was at home. I took it out for a walk when I was buying groceries in the morning. I took it to exercise while buying groceries and exercising. In the evening, I went out for a walk after dinner. Circle, digest food and relax body and mind, killing two birds with one stone. But last month, my husband felt that the pressure to support the family was a bit high. In order to increase his income, he took the initiative to ask his employer to go to Guangdong to take charge of a project. All the housework and childcare tasks at home are piled on me. It’s not a big problem for the eldest son to live on campus, but I have to keep an eye on the second son when he comes back every night to eat and do homework. He is very unself-disciplined. Whenever I come back from walking the dog, I see him turning on the TV without knowing why. In addition, my husband has repeatedly expressed the hope that I would stop sitting at home and find a job to supplement the family income. I have thought about it again and again. I am still five or six years away from retirement. In the long run, I also want to have an ordinary career. So I started to pay attention to job recruitment online every day. Sadly, at the age of 45, most of the resumes I submit online come to nothing, and I don’t even have the chance to be invited for an interview. A few jobs require me to work morning and evening shifts, which affects my ability to take care of my children. In recent days, a company finally extended an olive branch to me. Working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. six days a week is acceptable to me. But even if I leave early and come home late, and do housework, there is no time to take care of the dog... I started to think about whether to find a dog lover to adopt it, but I was worried about two things: 1. Will the other person adopt it? Be kind to the dog. 2. Will the dog be hurt inside? It always looks at me... The dog will live for more than ten years in the future. If it is unfortunate because of my wrong arrangements, I don&#39;t want to see it. Arrived. I am eager for the wise teacher Lian Yue to give me advice! 45-year-old innocent woman 45-year-old innocent woman: Dogs may be the cause of the most conflicts among the people. From time to time, tragedies involving people being bitten by dogs arouse everyone&#39;s fear and anger. These things would be tolerable if irresponsible dog owners could be held accountable and finally completely avoid biting people and disturbing people. Unfortunately, these things are often distorted by some people (basically stakeholders) and led into conflicts between dog owners and dog-free people, tearing the entire society apart, and reminding people of the previous XX Gong. It would be ridiculous for a family and a country to be divided, antagonized, and fight to the death because of dogs. In order not to be ridiculous. I feel that whether it is social governance at the macro level or raising a dog at the micro level, one principle must be followed: human rights are greater than dog rights. Not to mention the very small number of extremists who advocate that dog rights are greater than human rights, even the fact that many dog owners accept that &quot;dog rights are equal to human rights&quot; is not logically valid. Admit it, it’s hard to own a dog because buying and selling dogs is human trafficking. You can’t just give your newborn puppy to a friend, you must follow the adoption procedures in accordance with the law. You are less likely to spay or neuter a dog than you are to spay or neuter your child. The state also has to provide dogs with medical insurance and pensions. Human rights outweigh dog rights. From this point on, when you want to get a dog, you must get the consent of everyone in the family. You can&#39;t attack someone who disagrees as &quot;unloving&quot;, his human rights are more important. When your dog leaves the house and enters the public domain, you must also know that the human rights of all the people you meet are greater than the rights of your dog. Let alone bite people, it has no right to disturb others or do anything. Dirty public places. And you must know that many people are naturally afraid of dogs, just like many people are afraid when they see cockroaches. Even if they know that cockroaches can&#39;t hurt her, she will scream, freeze, and be afraid. If a dog owner takes his dog to a public place and thinks from the perspective of a person who is afraid of dogs, I think there will be far fewer conflicts. If you think &quot;everyone should love my dog as much as I do,&quot; then conflicts will break out at any time, you will be unhappy, and your dog will be worried and unsafe. Human rights outweigh dog rights. When you raise a dog, it damages family unity and increases family conflicts. Either it is financially unsustainable, or it makes it impossible for you to work. Then, dog rights infringe on human rights and adjustments should be made. Stray dogs (including stray cats) pose a hidden danger to everyone (especially children) - the mortality rate of rabies is 100%, and some children who are scratched or bitten by dogs may not tell their parents - for managers, if If no one takes them home and raises them, they have the responsibility to capture them to protect the safety of citizens. Otherwise, it is dereliction of duty. You should not feed stray cats in the future. They reproduce too much. Even if they do not harm people, they will kill a large number of insects and birds and unbalance the entire ecosystem. We should love the entire ecosystem. This is a greater love. . Have fun.

But when I was walking on the road normally, three gray teddy dogs suddenly ran towards me like crazy and I understood why they were not so-called strays. Dogs can also get out of control. What I mean is that the current point of contention is that these stray dogs have no civil subject to hold accountable, and these vicious biting dogs (not stray dogs) would be a bad thing if there were a so-called dog-loving association to stand up and protect the country from being bitten by stray dogs. If people behave responsibly or can eliminate safety hazards, I don’t think there will be so many people clamoring to catch dogs, but at the same time solve the problem instead of raising and expanding the problem.

54,"Celebrities are good enough to set the pace. My views are as follows: 1. Stray dogs are abandoned by dog owners, and irresponsible dog owners cause harm to public safety. 2. The owner of the dog who does not tie the leash is the one who should bear the dog’s life the most, not the victim girl and her family. Not tying the rope is the reason. 3. Accounts that spread rumors and curse girls should all be blocked. 4. To refute the dog owner’s statement that if you don’t mess with dogs, dogs won’t bite you. The news reports that a large number of dog owners are still bitten by domestic dogs after raising them for ten years. What’s more, wild dogs are more wild and can only be left on the street. There is a risk of biting if you get on them. 5. The so-called love is not love when the upper and lower lips touch each other. It only means talking and talking without paying any money. Those who want the public to share the place where stray dogs are taken are shameful. 6. Some people only mention that developed countries tolerate strays, but do not mention that developed countries screen out high-quality dog owners. The threshold for raising dogs is very high, and abandoning dogs also costs a lot. 7. The cause of the incident was obviously that the girl was bitten by an untied dog. I don’t know how the rhythm of public opinion was distorted to the ending where the stray dog was innocent and the girl was scolded? Forty million people in our country are bitten by cats and dogs every year, and some extreme dog lovers are extremely divided. While speaking out for stray dogs, they insult innocent girls.

55,"In many foreign countries, once a dog bites a person, it will be euthanized. There is no exception. When a dog bites a person here, there are a group of dog lovers who feel particularly uncomfortable. If you are not allowed to do this or that, it is because the person biting is not you. Not your relatives. As for stray dogs, stray dogs are not caused by the so-called dog lovers raising and abandoning them again. Who will manage a large number of stray dogs and then throw them to government agencies. The government will beat the stray dogs to death, and a group of people will lament. Don&#39;t beat them to death. Stray dogs also want people. What dog lovers want the government to do now is: you are not allowed to beat dogs, you have to distinguish between good dogs and bad dogs, and you want dogs not to bite people. This is a problem that dog lovers have created themselves, and they need others to deal with it, and they need to deal with it in a way that they themselves cannot achieve. The best way is for all dog lovers who call for the prohibition of beating dogs to form a stray dog alliance: 1. Donate. Since so many celebrities have called for it, just donate. Everything requires money, establish a stray dog base, and be responsible for feeding and caring for them. Stray dogs will die of old age, supervise stray dogs not to breed with each other, and vaccinate all stray dogs. 2. Become a volunteer yourself and implement a shift system, with three shifts in the morning, noon and evening, patrolling areas where stray dogs gather in urban and rural areas where people live, to prevent stray dogs from hurting people. 3.

56,"Last night, a caring old lady in our community posted a video of a stray dog biting a child in the group chat. I was thinking about this person who is the most diligent in feeding stray cats and dogs - the stray dog that almost bit me last year was the one that was brought into the community. She said she planned to adopt her, but she let her dog loose in the community because the family dog did not agree. Raised one - why did he suddenly change his temper? I found out this morning that she posted another video, to the effect that stray dogs bite people and the property management of the community is responsible. Haha, that’s it. Although the property management of the community is indeed responsible, isn&#39;t the biggest problem the caring people who admit stray dogs into the community? ! Want to feed stray dogs but are afraid of taking responsibility and dumping the blame in advance? This person&#39;s mind is really flexible! Now that this is the case, I, a legal illiterate, have to help the caring old lady to spread the law. So I spoke in the group: People who often feed stray dogs are regarded as dog owners. Stray dogs hurt people, and the people who feed them must be responsible. After I finished posting, I felt much better. There are many elderly people and children in our community, so we need to educate people on the law and build a safe and harmonious community together.

59,"Seeing those celebrities who feel sorry for stray dogs, I really want to ask those so-called celebrities: Stray dogs are pitiful, but aren&#39;t the children bitten by dogs pitiful? In your eyes, the captured stray dogs are pitiful, but what about the children bitten by dogs? Did he deserve to be bitten? In this people-oriented society, between dogs and people, shouldn’t the first thing we should pay attention to is people? Especially people bitten by dogs! Anyway, for me personally, I support catching stray dogs everywhere. Because I am afraid of dogs, especially those that are not tethered or muzzled. To be honest, when I went back to my hometown during the National Day, I was almost bitten by a dog. It was my grandfather’s dog, not a stray dog. What happened was that I went to my grandpa’s house for dinner with my brother, parents, grandparents and relatives, but because I was afraid of dogs, I subconsciously stayed away from them. However, the dog may be really sensitive to people who are afraid of it. It doesn&#39;t care about others and just keeps baring its teeth and barking at me. In fact, among the people present, my relatives, my brother and I were all strangers to the dog, but they didn&#39;t care about the dog&#39;s existence, and the dog didn&#39;t care about them. But when I showed a little fear, the dog wanted to attack me. When I was in my hometown, I rarely went to my grandparents&#39; house, because to go to their house, I had to pass through many doorsteps, especially the house closest to them. There was a family that kept dogs, and they were still big wolf dogs. A very fierce one. The key is, if you want to raise a dog, you should raise a dog. After all, this is a person’s freedom. However, that family often leaves the dog on a leash and often leaves the door open. Every time I pass by that family’s door, I am always on tenterhooks. So when I saw the girl in Sichuan being attacked by a vicious dog, I felt very sad. Then I felt relieved that stray dogs were being captured in various places. Maybe it was a bit overkill, but at least this capture could reduce a lot of possible harm. Stop saying that stray dogs are pitiful. The reason why stray dogs are pitiful is not because they are captured, but because they are strays. Ultimately, the responsibility of the humans who turn them into stray dogs is still theirs! As for &quot;my dog doesn&#39;t bite&quot;, that&#39;s your family&#39;s own business. You can let it go as you like in your own home. When you go out of your house and into public areas, you should do a good job of tying the dog, wearing a muzzle, and scooping out poop bags! People who are not afraid of dogs will never understand the fear that people who are afraid of dogs have for the existence of dogs! In public places, you should not only take care of yourself, but also take care of your pets. This is the best attitude when raising pets, especially dogs. Being less abandoned and more responsible is the best way to treat dogs!

63,"I am actually afraid of dogs. When I was a kid, I was chased by dogs several times on the way to school. Even now, when I see a dog staring at me, I feel a little weak. The most serious time for me was when I was carrying my younger brother to play with friends. I saw a few dogs from a distance on the road. As soon as the dogs saw us, they swarmed towards us, barking while chasing me. I was carrying my brother on my back. My brother ran away desperately. After returning home, I had nightmares for two consecutive nights. In the dream, I was chased by a dog. I ran while crying. I was frightened and woke up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat. My brother is okay, maybe he&#39;s too young and doesn&#39;t have the concept of fear yet. The most serious incident for my brother was one year in Jiaxing, when we went to visit our parents during the summer vacation. I took my brother to find a friend. When we passed by the neighbor&#39;s door (that road is a public area), a little white dog suddenly jumped out of the room and bit my brother&#39;s leg. I didn&#39;t expect it at all. There was a dog, and I was already afraid of dogs. I was petrified and didn&#39;t dare to move, so I kept crying. The crying attracted several adults and drove the dog back to their home. Later, my neighbor paid for my brother&#39;s vaccination, but other than that, there was no other compensation. As for my brother, he had several injections, and my parents took several leaves of absence to take my brother to the hospital. No one was responsible for the injuries my brother suffered and the losses my parents suffered. Therefore, I agree with dealing with some vicious dogs that endanger personal safety. Because I&#39;ve been hurt and I don&#39;t want to be hurt again. However, I don’t think we should kill them all. Just like people, dogs also have good and bad qualities. “One size fits all” for stray dogs is a bit cruel. However, we can’t blame the staff who carried out the work. It’s not easy for everyone. After all, if a stray dog bites someone, who will be held accountable? For example, if a biting incident occurs in the community, the innocent property management and security guards will be held responsible. They definitely don’t want this to happen, so they will not allow the dog to appear in the community. The same goes for other places. If you bite someone, someone will have to take responsibility when someone is held accountable. We are all ordinary people, and no one is willing to take responsibility for no reason, which results in the living space of stray dogs becoming smaller and smaller. If some people are willing to adopt stray dogs or take responsibility for stray dogs biting people, the current situation of stray dogs should be better. Therefore, some people should not just rely on their mouths to protect dogs, but also attack ordinary executives. Because you don&#39;t handle the dog, if something goes wrong in the future, they may be the ones to bear the responsibility. Why should they bear this responsibility because of your love? Let&#39;s understand each other. Of course, those who are capable and caring should encourage everyone to take action, such as donating money to build loving shelters for stray dogs, providing vaccination services, providing dog food, etc. In the final analysis, it is still a human problem. Dog owners should keep their dogs on leashes and muzzle their dogs; they should not abandon them at will; they are not allowed to keep dogs if they do not keep them; and when a dog bites someone, they must bear corresponding responsibilities according to the severity. Relevant community staff should do a good job in resettling stray dogs; vaccinations; sterilization; and control in place. I have seen how scary dogs can be, and I have also seen how cute dogs can be. I just hope that everything will get better, people&#39;s safety can be guaranteed, and dogs&#39; lives can become peaceful. I hope that all aspects will become more perfect, everything will become better, and people and animals can get along more harmoniously.

Its owner saw it, calmly pulled up the rope, and said to me with a smile, you Don&#39;t move, he will pounce on you if you move... That smiling expression made me think he was joking.

71,"Dogs are friends of dog owners, not our friends. Rather than saying that I hate dogs, I hate some dog owners. I was bitten by dogs three times when I was a child. Once I accidentally stepped on the landlord&#39;s dog, and it jumped up and bit me on the forehead. Okay. I&#39;m unlucky this time. The second time was when I was watching people at the intersection, a big wolf dog rushed over and bit me on the knee. The third time I went home and passed by someone else&#39;s house, the landlord opened the door and the puppy took the opportunity to run out and bit my heel. All three dogs were without leashes. From then on, for several years, whenever I saw a dog, my legs would go weak and my hands would sweat. I don’t dare to buy anything in a store less than 100 meters away. Even if I go shopping, I have to ride a bicycle. On the way to school, I saw a few dogs walking around and I didn&#39;t dare to walk past them. I had to pick up sticks or stones before walking. Don&#39;t say that my dog doesn&#39;t bite, don&#39;t be afraid, don&#39;t run away. When I was a kid, I didn’t know any golden retrievers at all. When I went home and passed by someone else’s house, the dog was half as tall as me. It didn’t have a leash. It would sniff around you as you passed by, and the owner wouldn’t pay attention. In order not to bump into this dog, I would do it every day. I took a long way home and Teddy, the most annoying dog, went out on a bicycle because he didn&#39;t dare to walk. As a result, he was chased and yelled at. People who only say they love dogs and dogs are human friends usually don&#39;t watch. I have not spoken out for victims, and I have never seen anyone advocating for dogs to be leashed and muzzled. Whenever they encounter a regulated stray dog, they come out to support it. However, please remember that dogs are the friends of their owners, not our friends. The world is indeed There are good dogs and bad dogs, but no one can guarantee that the dog you think is a good dog will go crazy and bite someone one day, not to mention that it is a stray dog and no one can be responsible for this. Don’t compare working dogs with stray dogs. Instead of asking others to protect animals, you should set an example and promote civilized dog-raising and never abandon it. After all, the appearance of stray dogs is definitely not caused by people like us who don’t own dogs, and we shouldn’t be left to worry about them.

72,"🔺Answer to the private message: I don’t want to get involved in this quarrel over the issue of stray cats and dogs, because both sides have certain truths and flaws in their opinions, and there is currently no final and perfect solution. 🔺I also don’t agree with what some people call “lazy government”. Just like the management of mobile stalls in urban management, this is a constantly changing balance in a chaotic model, and it may not necessarily be the “perfect” optimal one. The solution may not be generalizable to all places. It can only be maintained in the local area for a long time and must be adapted to the local current situation and reality. 🔺Essentially, strengthening the management of stray animals is the people’s higher demand for the reorganization of social rules. In this process, we must be active participants in grassroots governance to benefit the people, and do not be passive service users. This is economical. It is social governance capital that can finally solve the problem of stray animals in one&#39;s own community from the direction of neighborhood and organization. 🔺Why can’t the rat plague in New York be solved? Because social resource allocation capabilities have become profit-driven and distributed, social governance in the United States is completely market-oriented, resource-based, and project-oriented. When there are benefits, institutions and enterprises will be benefited first, and if there is excess, the American people will be benefited. There is no market. When interests and market mechanisms fail, they become paralyzed. 🔺Universal rodent eradication in the United States is a matter of lack of market interest. This is certainly not a problem that can be solved by the U.S. grassroots governance system that only pursues profit growth and does not maintain socially inclusive growth. 🔺It’s just a bit funny to see some typical profit-seeking groups instinctively refuse to redistribute resources and take advantage of many people’s kindness and love for pets.

75,"Trivia: People who are afraid of dogs or hate dogs will most likely not keep a dog, let alone abandon a puppy (not abandoning anything). So, where do stray dogs come from? I also strongly recommend improving the city’s pet-raising security measures, reviewing the qualifications of pet owners, standardizing pet-raising behaviors, starting from the source, whoever raises them will be responsible, and whoever throws them away will go to jail.

85,"[[, How to control stray dogs has become the most urgent social security issue in the safest country in the world. So, how to control the problem of stray dogs? This has to be said about Germany. The Germans&#39; regulations on raising dogs are really strict and are engraved in the hearts of Germans. Let China copy it, there is indeed something worth learning from capitalism. Here’s a summary of some of the rules for raising dogs in Germany: 1. Keeping a dog requires the consent of your neighbors. When raising a dog in Germany, you must first obtain the consent of your neighbors and ensure that it will not affect their lives. You can&#39;t let your dog urinate randomly, and you can&#39;t let your dog bark at home and disturb your neighbors&#39; rest. If you violate these regulations, you may be subject to fines or other penalties. 2. Dog owners and dogs must go to dog school. It costs 50 euros per hour to raise a dog in Germany. After your neighbor agrees, you have to take your puppy to dog school, from kindergarten to junior high school, and then the high school graduation exam. You and you Only when dogs get their diplomas can they enter society. 3. You have to pay tax for raising a dog. You have to pay it every year. Taking Berlin as an example, you need to pay 120 euros in tax every year to raise the first dog, and you have to pay another 180 euros to raise the second dog. If you keep a dog secretly without paying taxes, If found, a fine of 10,000 euros will be imposed. 4. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs. Dog owners should buy insurance for their dogs with a compensation of no less than 1 million euros. Under normal circumstances, German dog owners need to pay an annual insurance premium of 75 to 270 euros for their dogs, and dangerous dogs have to pay more than 30% more premiums. 5. Dog owners must spend enough time with their dogs. When raising a dog in Germany, dog owners need to spend a certain amount of time with their dogs. For example, owners should take their dogs with them when they go out, and they cannot let their dogs stay alone for more than 3 hours. If you do not walk your dog for a long time, someone will complain to an animal protection organization. The charge is that you torture small animals. 6. Dog owners are fined 90,000 euros for abandoning dogs. German law stipulates that anyone who abandons a dog (including those who move and leaves the dog in the same place) must be fined 90,000 euros and may be imprisoned for 3 years. 7. The chip must be implanted at your own expense. The European Union stipulates that all pets (cats, dogs, and minks) must have ID numbers. There are two forms available: one is to tattoo the number on a conspicuous part of the pet&#39;s skin; the other is to implant it under the skin. Enter the microchip. 8. Adoption costs money. In Germany, adoption is not free. For example, in Berlin, the cost of adopting a dog is generally 205 euros. 9. Documents are required. The pet’s identity certificate and health certificate are essential! 10. Dogs are not allowed to enter some public places. Dogs are strictly prohibited from entering children&#39;s playgrounds, leisure lawns, swimming pools and other places marked &quot;Dogs are not allowed&quot;. Those who fail to supervise dogs in public places will be fined 10,000 euros. 11. Feeding stray dogs is deemed as having custody. If a stray dog bites someone, the person feeding it will be responsible for compensation. 12. Stray dogs that are not adopted are killed.

87,"Originally, I wanted to cull urban ferocious dogs, but small dogs should be treated differently. They should be adopted or left as stray dogs. After all, small dogs can do no harm. However, animal protection is really scary. Millions of people were bombed in Gaza and no one saw their sympathy. When a little girl was bitten, they showed no concern. Now when dealing with stray dogs, they start to make a fuss. The key is that just scolding someone is inhumane, and it is impossible to ignore it completely. After all, who will be responsible for biting someone again, who is opposed to culling? Stray dogs are indeed not suitable for living in densely populated cities. How about adopting them as soon as possible? If they cannot be adopted, they can only be rendered harmless, or dog lovers can donate money and help to build shelters. If you love dogs, you have to raise dogs that no one wants. Otherwise, what is it called loving dogs? The more pitiful the dog, the more it should be adopted. Breeding new puppies is completely unnecessary. If a stray dog is adopted, everyone in the world will be happy. If you don’t want to adopt something so harmless, everyone is a cruel executioner. What’s the point of scolding the person responsible for handling the dog? Why let someone be the villain and then maintain the illusion of kindness with peace of mind? It’s too white and left-handed.

In desperation, she jumped into the vegetable field next to them.

90,"A lot of quarrels stemmed from different definitions, such as the initial liberalization and lockdown, and they were so quarrelsome. In the end, I showed the Shijiazhuang liberalization policy posted online to a friend in a city in the south who supported the continued lockdown. She said that’s right. We should continue to lock down the city like this! So sometimes simply saying that we support a certain definition can lead to misunderstanding. So I think it’s best to explain everything clearly one by one. Relevant legislation on pet protection 1: Pet market management 1, define the scope of pets and the list of prohibited pets, and update them in a timely manner. 2. Standardize pet breeding. Certificates must be obtained, the venue must meet the standards, disinfection and vaccination should be carried out on time, sterilization should be carried out when the age is reached, and the management department should conduct random inspections at any time to avoid the quality of garbage in the backyard. A chip is implanted at the factory, and you can scan the code to know the age, breed, vaccination status and other information of the pet. 3. Standardize the breeding of meat dogs. Like pigs, cattle and sheep, they are inspected and quarantined before leaving the factory. The sources of dog meat are subject to the same supervision. Restaurants selling dog meat do not dare to buy meat from unknown sources. Food safety is guaranteed, and the property rights of pet owners are also guaranteed. 4. The state will establish municipal animal management centers with funds from animal protection organizations, and subsequent operating costs will be paid from pet insurance premiums and fines for violators. 5. Referring to car sales, all stores selling pets must register information with the industrial and commercial and animal management centers and be connected to the Internet in real time. The sources of pets sold in the store must provide valid certificates. 6. The buyer will register and pay the fee at the store where he purchased the pet. The store will issue an invoice, register the pet’s sales and owner information, enter the information into the system and upload it to the management center. The management center will return the confirmation information before taking the pet out of the store. The pet&#39;s internal chip is updated simultaneously to add information about pet owners. 7. If an individual no longer keeps the animal, regardless of whether it is sold or transferred, all the animals must go to the Municipal Animal Management Center to go through the transfer procedures. 8. Municipal animal management centers and stray animal shelters are state departments and cannot be contracted by individuals. The staff must be established and people must take public examinations to enter the centers and shelters. Veterinarians and other related industries are given priority. 2: Breeding Qualification Certification 1. Regardless of adoption or purchase, a unified knowledge test will be conducted, referring to the driver&#39;s license. If you are not qualified, you will not be issued a qualification certificate. You are not allowed to raise pets without a license, and you are not allowed to &quot;raise for others&quot;. 2. Because pets are different from cars, there may be situations where there is only one person holding a license and multiple people raising them at home. Here you can refer to the penalties for lending a vehicle to an unlicensed person: No matter what you do at home, you must have a certificate when you go out. If you walk a dog without a license, you will be found out. As for the penalty, if a dog hurts someone and causes a traffic accident while driving without a license, the penalty will be doubled. 3. I personally don’t want special pets such as snakes to be counted as pets. If they are included in the scope of pets, they should refer to the ABC driver’s license model, obtain a special qualification certificate, and upgrade the penalties for abandonment and loss. Don&#39;t be tempted to buy one and keep it for a few days before letting it go. Regardless of whether you buy a snake, fox or any other messy &quot;pet&quot;, anyone who releases it will be criminally charged and financially punished. 4. The certificates obtained by large dogs and small and medium-sized dogs are different. Large dogs must participate in the physical test. The certificate holder must undergo physical tests regularly. Those who cannot control the large dog will not be issued a certificate. Large dogs are required to have one license per household, and one person is not allowed to walk two large dogs. Three: Breeding Code of Conduct 1. Do not abuse or kill animals. People who abuse and kill animals can easily escalate into crimes and should be arrested. Anyone who intentionally spreads a video of torture and murder, whether for profit or not, is considered a crime endangering public safety and must be punished. 2. The license holder will be deducted 2 points and fined 200 if he walks his dog without a leash or picking up feces; if the dog urinates on other people&#39;s wheels, he will be deducted 3 points and fined 200; if he abandons the dog, he will be deducted 12 points for three years. No more qualification certificates are allowed; if a dog bites someone, 12 points will be deducted directly, and the dog owner will be punished according to the severity of the injury, including financial and civil criminal penalties. 3. If a dog bites a dog, the injured party will compensate the injured party for buying the dog, and will be deducted points and fined. 4. Pets that exceed 12 points will be confiscated. 5. Dogs that bite people cannot be kept and will be killed. 6. Dog barking is prohibited in residential areas, and horn honking will be handled as if it is a prohibited area in the city. 7. Pet theft is punished as theft. The chip information contains the purchase price. If the amount is larger, the thief will naturally go to jail. Restaurants that purchase and sell meat from unknown sources are subject to penalties by the Food and Drug Administration, Market Administration and other departments. There are already relevant laws on this, so just add dog meat. 8. In the case of a car hitting a dog and killing it, refer to the division of liability for traffic accidents. If the dog is not tied up, the dog is fully responsible. If the dog is tied up and the dog is not going crazy and trying to break free at the time of the accident, the driver will pay full compensation and give compensation. A certain amount of mental damages. Four: Treatment of Stray Animals 1. The state establishes stray animal shelters at the expense of animal protection organizations. Until the pet market is completely regulated, the shelters are merged into the municipal pet management center and are responsible for temporarily housing confiscated pets. 2. At the expense of animal protection organizations, the state organizes dog catching teams to catch stray dogs. If animal protection is concerned about accidental injuries when catching dogs, the animal protection organization can catch them, or they can hire a professional dog hunting team. However, no matter where they are caught, they will be sent to a shelter for unified management. Private transfers are not allowed to cause management chaos. 3. If a staff member is bitten by a dog when catching a dog, the animal protection organization will bear the rabies vaccine, lost wages, medical expenses, etc. 4. The staff of the shelter are responsible for registering, managing the animals in the station, and implanting microchips. 5. Animal vaccines, storage costs, purchase of food and water and other related expenses will all be borne by the animal protection organization. The cost of the chip is borne by the adopter. 6. The National Stray Animal Shelter accepts donations from caring people in the society. The donation accounts are made public in real time. A scrolling screen in the lobby is updated in real time, and the website is updated simultaneously. Donors can freely choose to remain anonymous or make their names public. 7. If an individual has a stray animal that he feeds, and after getting familiar with it, successfully catches it and wants to adopt it, he can directly take the animal to the management center to have the chip implanted, pay the chip fee, and go through the relevant procedures. Adoption is allowed first, and the qualification certificate will be obtained within three months. That’s it. 8. If an individual feeds stray animals and wants to adopt them but cannot catch them, he can report to the shelter and request for arrest. After being caught, the feeder will have priority to adopt them, but he must first obtain a qualification certificate before he can adopt them. 9. If you are trying to catch a dog and are blocked by the person who has been feeding it, and the person who feeds the dog is not qualified to adopt it and is not allowed to catch it, it will be regarded as obstructing city management and will be criticized and educated by the police. 10. If you think the rations at the shelter are not good enough, the breeder can pay to buy the rations during the shelter period, and the rations are guaranteed to be used exclusively by pets. 11. Publish adoption information through social media such as official accounts, in order of capture time. 12. The adopter can choose the intended animal by himself through the public account mini-program. Each household is allowed to have three intentions. After checking, the appointment time is determined. 13. The appointment time is the time when the adopter arrives at the shelter. If the appointment is overdue, the account will be expired and re-appointed. If it is overdue three times, the account will be locked. Re-election is allowed after 180 days. 14. If multiple people like the same animal, they will be sorted by the reservation time. For example, A likes the civet cat and pear, and chooses the reservation time as 9:00 am on October 22, 2023. Then the earliest reservation time that B can choose is At 10:00 am on the 15th, the adopter comes to adopt with the qualification certificate, the shelter registers personal information, and the information is synchronized to the management center through the Internet. 16.

Ordinary people can only feed a little and adopt one or two. Occasionally, ordinary people will sell the iron. Sheltering, but so many stray dogs still have no place to put them, let’s be practical. With so many stray dogs, let’s first talk about how to reduce the number of stray dogs. Then we must control the abandonment. How to deal with the abandoned people, and how to deal with them? Sterilize traffic dogs, a two-pronged approach to curb the increase at the source. Let’s talk about how to reduce the stock. This is the part that is said to be culled. How to reduce it? If you can adopt it, you can adopt it. If you can’t adopt it, donate money or dogs to other shelters or individuals. Food, let someone manage it. Let’s talk about the problem of stray dogs biting people. It’s confirmed that they bit people while they were standing there without doing anything. Then there is no other way but to cull them. They have never bitten people in schools or anything like that. There is really no need to cull the dogs that are recorded. Besides, there seems to be management methods for pet dogs in cities. As a dog owner, you must at least have a leash. There are not many people who can&#39;t do it. Small and medium-sized dogs are the hardest hit. Do you love dogs or are you unqualified? Especially male dogs, which account for a large proportion of free-range dogs. Doesn’t it mean that your family has a male dog? When will pet dogs across the country be allowed to have leashes? Can you please appeal for this? Ah, don’t tell me that people who don’t love dogs are afraid. When I go out with a dog and encounter someone without a leash, I feel disgusted. The leash is also not safe, because if the dog is not weak or the owner loosens his grip, it may suddenly He ran away at once, so you should pay more attention to the ones who ran out of the house without closing the door. Pay more attention and worry more. Whose child is loved by others? If you love it, take care of it.

Anyway, they have insurance. , more secure than a dog biting someone. If one drunk driver causes an accident and all drunk drivers pay the bill together, is it a one-size-fits-all approach?

98,"There has been a lot of discussion on the Internet these days about the problem of stray dogs. I hope everyone will turn their attention back to the matter itself - the problem this time is that the dog owner was irresponsible, causing the two-year-old girl to be seriously injured. So here are the questions: 1. The Rottweiler dog that bites people is a fierce dog with the ability to kill. Dogs are banned in the city. How did he enter the community and become a pet? 2. As a dog owner, why would a dog with such killing ability be let loose? 3. Rottweiler is an exotic breed and not a native breed. Who is behind the breeding and selling of these breeds that are neither native nor suitable for urban breeding? I have seen people talking about adoption in many places. I must say this. Even if everyone who loves dogs has one, as long as there is a hypocritical dog and a male and a female, there will be 4-6 dogs in one litter. Count them as 4. , half male and half female, the next birth cycle will be 3 pairs of dogs giving birth, 3*4=12, plus the original 6, 18. As long as someone abandons it, no matter how you adopt it, it will be useless. Continuing from the previous article, our family has a dog. It is also a little local dog that was kidnapped instead of sold and adopted. He is always on a leash when he goes out, because he is usually taught how to get along with people. Generally, he has no problem getting along with people or dogs when he goes out. Usually when no one is around, they will let him run around in an open and uninhabited place within sight of others, to have fun or something. There is an old man in the same city who takes his two greyhounds for a walk. He keeps saying that his dogs are like those dogs from abroad that can kill anything. He even releases his dogs in public parks to cull them. Stray cats and other small animals. Proudly praising his dogs for their good bites. Some children were frightened and cried. I can&#39;t understand this. If you don&#39;t have a sense of responsibility in raising a dog, please don&#39;t keep it. Harm dogs and humans. I hope those who read my words will know that we are all working for a better life. The essence of everyone is to discover problems, analyze problems, and solve problems. It is normal behavior for everyone to express their opinions. But don&#39;t say hurtful things just to vent. The world has been messed up by some bad-hearted people. It will be better if we clean it up. Good night.

I didn’t know what to say, how else could I watch it, so I lay on the bed and read it. Before a stray dog bites someone, you will never be able to tell which one is a good dog or a bad dog. It doesn’t matter if it looks normal one second and then pounces on you and bites you the next. If it is bitten, the person who was bitten will have to look for it again. Who is responsible? My question is: Stray dogs usually make a living by picking up food. If they don’t have an owner, and the bite is not serious, do they have to consider themselves unlucky? Again, if it is really for the good of the dog, adopt it and give it a home. Keep the dog on a leash and walk it in a civilized manner, instead of barking and yelling on the Internet.

100,"[: Security guards fired to hold department heads responsible for management] Recently, it was reported on the Internet that a security guard at the school drove away and disposed of stray dogs, which caused concern. After investigation and verification by the school, the situation was true. After investigation, it was found that a security officer of our school seriously misbehaved when driving away stray dogs, resulting in the death of the stray dogs and causing serious adverse effects. At present, the school has dismissed the security personnel involved and held management responsibilities against the department heads. As a school staff, love is the bottom line standard. This incident reflects the school&#39;s deficiencies in the education and management of security personnel, for which the school deeply apologizes. Our school will effectively strengthen education and training, improve working methods, and enhance the level of campus management. Data shows that in 2021, the number of stray cats will be as high as 53 million, and the number of stray dogs will be as high as 40 million. Hot discussion among netizens: Orange domain root server: Hehehe, if a student is bitten by a stray dog, the security guard will have to be fired. It is really difficult to do something at the grassroots level. A Hunanese working in Guangzhou: School is a place for teaching and educating people, and it is for young people. , where young people establish their outlook on life, if such things as indifference to life, cruelty and killing of animals are allowed to happen, it will teach bad students. Sister Qi, please try harder_: Now it has evolved into two extremes. The ones who cause all this are those who always think that their dogs will not bite people and wander around without leashes. There is also a kind of people who raise dogs on a whim and cause everywhere on the street. They are all stray dogs. What do you think is the best way to deal with stray pets?

101,"No big words, you are all so kind, and I have never seen you pay a penny. I don’t know how the stray dogs came here? Isn’t it caused by you “dog lovers” abandoning them? Isn’t it because people who hate dogs get bored after keeping them for a while and then abandon them? He kept saying, &quot;Dogs are so cute, why would you hurt them?&quot; Solving the problem of these stray dogs is very simple, just one question: who is responsible. If a stray dog bites someone, is it someone else&#39;s fault or are you responsible? Or is the government responsible? Let the government take responsibility. Does the government really have the ability to take responsibility for the problem of approximately 40 million stray dogs? The answer is obviously no. Even if there is, why choose a solution that is expensive, takes a lot of time and manpower, and has poor results as dog lovers continue to abandon it? (Dog slaves don’t mention foreign countries, all foreign countries have been culled) So, back to the question, can dog lovers be held responsible? That&#39;s not okay, it&#39;s too fatal. Just like now, the little girl&#39;s injury is kept silent, but the dog is so cute, but it is mentioned in an endless loop.

104,"After the recent biting incident in Lonawe, many places began to arrest and even torture and kill stray dogs. Seeing the two groups of people on the Internet holding different opinions and arguing endlessly, I am really afraid to discuss this matter on a public platform. I am timid and cowardly, and I am afraid of being misunderstood and being criticized, but as someone who has had two extreme attitudes towards dogs, I still want to share my opinion. Before graduating at the age of 23, I had a very negative attitude towards dogs. When I was a child, I was bitten two or three times for no apparent reason, and I had to take a detour when I saw a puppy. What I remember very clearly is that my dad’s classmate from his hometown had a very big dog, and if he wanted to go to the toilet, he had to go through it. In the woodshed where the dog lived, I would rather let my mother take me to the toilet next door than to pass by the &quot;demon&quot; in my eyes. After graduating at the age of 23, I often spend my free time after get off work watching cute dog pictures and videos to heal my tired soul. In November of my first year on the job, my passion for raising a dog reached its peak. After dinner every night, I would search around the rental house, trying to &quot;pick up dogs&quot;; for a while, I would often buy ham sausages at a convenience store and feed them to the stray dogs around Zhabei Park. I really wanted to have my own dog, so after doing a lot of homework, I took a car with my friend for more than an hour after work on a Friday to adopt a stray dog from a pet shop near Gucun Park. From that time on, my love for dogs evolved from simply thinking they were cute, to treating them as my own relatives from the bottom of my heart. Raising a dog is not a casual job. You have to walk it every morning and evening, and you have to be ready to pick up poop with your hands when walking. Dogs are not always obedient. Sometimes they will not listen to your orders and run rampant, stealing food, and taking advantage of others. Make trouble when you&#39;re not home. These are all the preparations you need to make before raising a dog. You cannot just want it to be cute without wanting to be responsible for it. The lifespan of a dog is about 15 years. If you raise a dog, you must keep it as long as possible and accompany them until life. The end. But what is hateful is that many people keep dogs on a whim, causing countless tragedies involving stray dogs. So are stray dogs wrong? It’s the irresponsible dog owners who are at fault. After seeing the news, I repeatedly emphasized to my parents in the group that when I go out for a walk, I must keep a leash and even wear a muzzle. This is to protect the dogs and is also responsible for them. Because the family in your eyes may also be the devil in the eyes of others. Only by comparing each other&#39;s hearts can we reach a consensus. In addition, I have to reflect on myself. I am the kind of person who has no sense of boundaries when it comes to dogs. Sometimes when I see a cute dog on the road, I want to go up and ask the owner if I can pet it. This must be changed. It&#39;s normal to love dogs, but you have to be clear in your heart that every dog has different habits. If the owner says it doesn&#39;t bite, it&#39;s just for the owner and acquaintances. For you, a stranger, you may irritate it if you are not careful. Isn’t the news about a woman with her child being bitten by a dog on the street with her face covered in blood enough to scare you? Regulate your own behavior. If you have a dog, raise it seriously and responsibly. Treat it like a family member. Keep it on a leash and wear a muzzle when going out. Give way to people who are afraid of dogs when you encounter them in public places. Be more understanding towards others. Only by being yourself can you shut others up. I really feel that killing stray dogs is not something a civilized society should do. Beating all the stray dogs to death with a hammer is chilling. Some netizens will definitely say, why do you favor dogs when you still eat chicken and pork? What kind of saint are you? I really have nothing to say to this kind of people. I wish each other well.

108,"When I first learned that the little girl was so deeply injured by the city’s banned dogs, I couldn’t understand why she targeted stray dogs. There were two main factors in the little girl’s incident: First, the supervision of the city’s banned dogs was not strong enough. Well, some people don&#39;t even know there are cities that ban dogs. Second, some dog owners lack rules. They can do whatever they want at home, but when you go out, you have to be responsible for your dog and you have to be responsible for passers-by. A leash and a muzzle for large dogs are the most basic. I have a little Corgi who is less than one year old. He is super well-behaved and never barks at anyone, not even once. However, I always keep the dog on a leash every time I go out for a walk! Why? Puppies are ignorant, and so are people? Later, I learned that the problem of stray dogs in our country is very serious. I saw many pictures of children being bitten, which made me feel distressed. I understand that the current killing of stray dogs is paving the way for subsequent supervision, so I also hope that there will be other cute puppies like Xiao Huang. , don’t be beaten to death because you don’t have a clear owner. If there are really important dogs around you, people with the ability and conditions still hope to adopt them. After all, it is a life. If you adopt it, please be responsible for it. If I don’t plan to keep it, just pretend I didn’t say so. Secondly! ! Strengthen the supervision of abandoned animals! Otherwise stray dogs will always exist! Popularize dog certificates and make real-name registration mandatory when adopting! Once a year! If discarded or died unnaturally, your credit report will be affected! (Those garbage dog owners who have not considered taking responsibility for their lives and are not mentally prepared should be able to think about it carefully, even if they are forced to do so.) I see that many people always take the companion animals that others invest money, energy and emotions into. Compared with chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs, I would say that such people must have never raised pets. Why are companion pets called companion pets? Because of the affection that the pet owner has invested in it, it is a small animal that has been raised for three to five years, especially when it is alone in the field, with only one small animal to accompany it, and it is afraid to tell the family about bad things, and it is hard to work alone late at night. When you have a breakdown, you can still have it nuzzling you to express comfort. It is not an exaggeration to say that you are a family member. On the one hand, I want to tell you why companion animals are different from those chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs, especially for pet owners. I also hope that pet owners can understand that not everyone likes our babies, so protect your babies well, keep your dog on a leash when going out, and wear a muzzle for large dogs! (I don’t mean that pets are nobler than people. I just want to say that pets are different from domestic animals. Pay attention to the key points and don’t be harsh.) Finally, I hope that the country can introduce complete policies and measures to raise the threshold for raising pets and raising the threshold for abandoning pets (suggestion) Sentences for abandoning pets), universal dog licenses, fines for not leash-holding and not wearing muzzles, pet biting has been raised as a criminal case, and retirement benefits for working dogs such as police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and guide dogs have been improved. (At least don’t put the lives of these dogs who contribute to society in danger) I hope the relevant departments can see it, and I also hope that there will be fewer and fewer dog bites. d",289,-0.01684804283574192,5,4,282,31,2,6,0,0,5,0,100.0,"[0.924294590802008, 0.9407887271659605, 0.9186880895466358, 0.44690174744268696, 0.8340966875797816, 0.5484089598126693, 0.31152648818215656, 0.2784174005786142, 0.49549607467128487, 0.7269646208060467, 0.21958870239707828, 0.8132415763024278, 0.8423171944405441, 0.49774378290890187, 0.9201282060005365, 0.5262327818078083, 0.5920531120498399, 0.5863562808369425, 0.9986294969723168, 0.5353912052319558, 0.60143903338377, 0.9954694390040159, 0.768410893174329, 0.4082996133757897, 0.7544789281429807, 0.7096048196441729, 0.9457504522767461, 0.3686596286094904, 0.4770264152449125, 0.24000877124332798, 0.5262327818078083, 0.6453037435507977, 0.9530558741649248, 0.718854289510093, 0.3505382355827944, 0.3750780384166793, 0.5294947133879233, 0.8954729178081248, 0.9100383350433259, 0.4673080491530388, 0.9999956425407587, 0.8059451101810462, 0.999995254638493, 0.9980343229998455, 0.9586588501228998, 0.24031502891241685, 0.98996947990551, 0.38323822868515345, 0.19368234726448497, 0.6428571428571431, 0.3570295927844761, 0.9859944692787299, 0.9912430071126688, 0.5831805964159829, 0.8646634245782164, 0.875167991516095, 0.43372715972511444, 0.7538302126257268, 0.7650291393108728, 0.5750484166955472, 0.8600149765364852, 0.538384916033958, 0.9646400966211055, 0.28024999688285035, 0.718854289510093, 0.8620964437185696, 0.8824190436330047, 0.4737672181921926, 0.5815017734688526, 0.7211245917762403, 0.9720203478182519, 0.5493979431576261]"

At around 22:30 on October 17, 2023, a student at Chongqing University of International Business and Economics was chased by a stray dog on his way home. After the school security discovered it, considering campus safety, the security guard The stray dog was driven away and died during the driving process. After investigation, the security personnel did engage in improper behavior in the process of driving away and dealing with stray dogs. The school has currently suspended the security guards involved. (China News Network) A two-year-old girl in Chongzhou, Chengdu, was bitten by a vicious dog. The tragic incident touched people&#39;s hearts and triggered the anger of the whole society against uncivilized dog breeding. Actions were launched to combat uncivilized dog breeding and stray dogs in various places. Among them, short video platforms On the Internet, the frequent killings of stray dogs, represented by Chongqing University of International Business and Economics, triggered heated discussions among netizens, and the public opinion field began to divide. Some netizens supported this behavior and believed that it was indeed conducive to protecting public safety, but most netizens were We express our opposition and condemnation, and are deeply saddened by this. Dogs are the most common animals in the world. They are not born with a standard owner. Nature and wind, snow, rain and moon are their habitat. The word wandering itself should not be given to them. The place where they live is Their territory, whether it is streets, trash cans or flower beds, we all live in the same earth home. Why not solve the problem fundamentally, introduce relevant laws and regulations, raise pets in a civilized manner, raise pets in accordance with the law, and use systems to manage and restrict them. And we have to choose this extreme method to kill all the dogs with one rod. There are bad people and good people. In the same way, there are bad dogs and good dogs. They are also living lives like us, with red color. Blood has breathing and temperature. Do you think the search and rescue dogs of the Wenchuan earthquake, the drug detection dogs at the border, and the guide dogs for the blind are less great than humans? We cannot exclude others based on generalizations in order to protect ourselves. As human beings, we should distinguish between good and bad, protect the weak, and find better solutions. This is what we should do. The root cause of the stray dog disaster lies in people&#39;s indiscriminate behavior, and the corresponding social rescue capabilities and management levels are insufficient. For the many stray dogs that cannot find a home, it is far better to introduce relevant policies to encourage social welfare than to use manpower and material resources to hunt and kill them on the streets. The organization participates in the rescue and encourages caring families to adopt them. For example, on October 18, the Linfen Small Animal Protection Association issued a document saying that the Linfen Urban Management Bureau sent all stray dogs to the base, where they can be treated kindly by caring people and their lives are respected, and encouraged the public to adopt them. In order to fundamentally curb the social problems caused by stray dogs, we should improve the registration and daily management of residents’ dog ownership from the source, improve relevant laws and regulations, increase penalties for those who abandon pets for no reason, and punish those who cause personal injury. Vicious incidents will be severely punished in accordance with the law. In short, it is a vicious dog that bites people. The root cause of the tragedy lies in the negligence of irresponsible dog owners. Innocent stray dogs should not be affected. All things in the world are equal. Humans should not kill innocent people indiscriminately. All living beings have the right to be treated. Respect, you don’t have to love but please don’t hurt. What stray dogs need is love and care, and they should receive reasonable protection. News commentsStray dogs put away d",324,-0.001502948130023327,20,16,293,15,4,7,0,1,7,0,100.0,"[0.9091723429094432, 0.0781738880291083, 0.9307956421314041, 0.7137835533092912, 0.9166666666666667, 0.7789859589268341, 0.7848834423144098, 0.2682926829268295, 0.6451321031003779, 0.6771889881076659, 0.5738668466055173, 0.9425730470085332, 0.9398026603787788, 0.9949081719793099, 0.5414982050136463, 0.9806564642683341, 0.7447639870626548, 0.7949425782551106, 0.1881698466544004, 0.8790642612801549, 0.10611543970538018, 0.7380687155741028, 0.9936239224828941, 0.28247976252517193, 0.8089905677401533, 0.987855257885409, 0.568029906057969, 0.5746308593108054, 0.9974760302184015, 0.21975192200674543, 0.9219886269482387, 0.9923585064737072, 0.9099145349915262, 0.9797282663658042, 0.40953993309785264, 0.5515432350947508, 0.6182831973030206, 0.9637946124424666, 0.9215658103700926, 0.7619047619047622, 0.36575875486381326, 0.39041446358519516, 0.9848132715927188, 0.12992843172303215, 0.28858151491487116, 0.9292035398230089, 0.5253205126538033, 0.7423317315079364, 0.782218160968133, 0.47302939912101705, 0.9942627591128427, 0.9443379772838041, 0.968777471055592, 0.9832790988143968, 0.9889869063446534, 0.14822639876290522, 0.8402148781561163, 0.8909427889266127, 0.9565376133287035, 0.8958101313586959, 0.9359569050930332, 0.9947507144887751, 0.4983366146203113, 0.9835495019567195, 0.051026629176065263, 0.09619077089968087, 0.5262327818078083, 0.5243381426544819, 0.7295529835925386, 0.9779542949601601, 0.9979739316103168, 0.866709092669643, 0.9478857274882334, 0.586648750458734, 0.9801021458234931, 0.6153846153846152, 0.9579756557154111]"

They hold on to the last hope of the world. A little longing, the last bit of trust in human beings.

At present, the school has dismissed the security personnel involved and held management responsibilities against the department heads. As a school staff, love is the bottom line standard. This incident reflects the school&#39;s deficiencies in the education and management of security personnel, for which the school deeply apologizes.

140,"I shed a lot of tears while browsing Weibo all afternoon. I am also a dog owner. I have two cute dogs. The little girl was bitten. I feel very sorry for the 2-year-old child who was bitten like this. Her parents first raised funds from the society. Although I have some doubts about the matter, I also hope that this little girl can be safe and healthy. I am very angry about this off-leash Rottweiler and its owner. Although I have dogs, I think the biting and hurtful Rottweiler is harmless or not. Sending it away is what it deserves, and the owner should compensate and take responsibility. Unexpectedly, this matter gradually evolved into something different than imagined...Many people began to hunt and kill stray cats and dogs around them, clamoring for human rights on the Internet. Above all else, we need to clean up all the stray cats and dogs, and even look like they are filled with righteous indignation. Normally civilized dog owners do not dare to take them out easily during this period. Some extreme people will poison and abuse them. I really don’t understand why people can do this. Dogs that hurt people should be dealt with. No one thinks there is a problem. But what&#39;s wrong with Xiao Huang? What&#39;s wrong with stray dogs that don&#39;t hurt people? If they had a home, they would want to be homeless. Can only humans exist in this world? When I see so many celebrities speaking out for stray dogs and commenting on moral kidnapping, I hate myself for not being able to do anything to help those innocent dogs and cats who are called &quot;stray&quot;. There were so many search and rescue dogs to help rescue people during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Countless people are their kind. We can’t save them, but can we not kill them easily? Is the one-size-fits-all policy too arbitrary? There are so many things I want to say, and I can’t type them to describe the pain I feel after seeing so many innocent dogs suffer. The world is really not just about humans... dogs who hurt people deserve to die, but other innocent cats and dogs living in this world are not wrong. I hope that they are not the only ones in this world.

146,"Now this issue is very complicated, let me summarize it. First of all, not all stray cats and dogs bite people, but there are indeed many stray cats and dogs that bite people, mainly stray dogs, but stray cats can also harm birds (about this, we cannot say that this is an ecological chain, which will be explained later) ). Therefore, many people attribute dog bites to this one incident and think it is wrong to punish only this dog and this owner. If an owner&#39;s dog bites a person, he or she can get compensation, but who will pay for the stray dog that bites a person? Do you consider yourself unlucky? Some people will say that not all dogs bite, and those that do need to be dealt with. But how to judge whether a dog bites or not? After all, dogs are beasts and will not follow human laws. Humans have legal constraints after all. The dog may not, it may be hungry, irritated out of nowhere, or out of belligerence, etc. It may bite people. Many domestic dogs may look docile but bite people suddenly at a certain moment, not to mention... Unsupervised stray dogs. So should we wait until it bites a person before punishing the dog? This is obviously not possible. As I said before, no one will compensate the bitten person. Even if there is compensation, the bitten person will still suffer great harm. Some people use the analogy of humans. Although it is too lofty to say so, the interests of humans are higher than those of stray dogs, so the analogy cannot be made, and humans have various constraints. Human beings are equal, but humans and dogs are not equal. So how to solve this problem? Just kill all stray cats and dogs across the board? It doesn&#39;t seem to work. On the one hand, it&#39;s too cruel. Cats and dogs are different from chickens and ducks and are more humane. On the other hand, this will be resisted by many dog lovers. In addition, some stray cats and dogs have established friendly relationships with nearby humans, will not harm humans easily, and also provide humans with a lot of fun. then what should we do? I think we can set up an organization for stray cats and dogs. The members of this organization cannot be extreme dog lovers or dog haters. The management of stray cats and dogs can be like this. First, we must identify stray cats and dogs that can be tamed and adopted. Register and find an adopter. In order to prevent behavior that harms the animal after adoption, you can return for irregular visits. For stray cats and dogs that have not been adopted yet, if they have established friendly relationships with the people around them and are determined not to harm anyone, they can be vaccinated and sterilized to prevent the creation of more stray cats and dogs, and then managed by unified numbers. Secondly, for stray cats and dogs that are not sure whether they hurt people or have no fixed place to live, they can be placed away from cities and people, or placed in shelters (maybe this is more feasible), but new problems arise. Where does the food for cats and dogs come from? It is not a bad idea to eat leftovers if the conditions are poor. After all, this is what strays eat. If you care more about stray cats and dogs, you can also feed dogs that are more suitable for cats and dogs. Feed cat food, but this requires funds, so donations can be made regularly. I believe real dog lovers will donate some. Of course, if it is determined that the dog has a ferocious temperament or has bitten someone for no reason, it cannot be kept anymore. If the dog has a ferocious temperament, it can be released in an uninhabited place in the wild, or it can be euthanized if it bites a person. A similar approach can be applied to the matter of stray cats killing birds. Another purpose of setting up the organization is that if someone is bitten by a stray cat or dog, the organization can compensate it. The funds are also raised through donations. After all, those who agree to keep these stray cats and dogs should also be responsible for this. They can&#39;t just talk and not take care of themselves. Be responsible for your words and deeds. The smallest unit of an institution can be a community, or a street. Some people say that stray cats and dogs are members of the ecosystem and humans should not interfere. But the problem is that on the one hand, the emergence of most stray cats and dogs is directly or indirectly caused by human abandonment, and they are invasive species. In other words, they are not wild animals, so they are not part of the ecological chain, and even in cities and even There are no natural predators in the countryside, which will cause great harm to other wild animals. Secondly, humans will feed stray cats and dogs or place them in shelters to reduce their worries about survival. They will breed in large numbers, and even if an excellent ecological chain has been or can be formed, human excessive intervention at the top of this food chain and Protection will also further cause harm to other animals and plants in the food chain. After all, humans do not care about other animals in the food chain, but only care about stray cats and dogs. This is not selfish and self-motivated. Birds being harmed by cats and dogs are part of the natural food chain. Only cats and dogs who are harmed due to climate and food reasons deserve sympathy, right? Some people say that cats and dogs will not kill birds when they are full, but for some cats, it is natural to kill birds, and being full will only make them more powerful. But people don’t see the birds in the sky, they only care about invasive species. Of course, we cannot generalize. Not all cats are like this, so please refer to the above for classification and treatment methods.

174,"At that time, the implementation of gun barrels was also one-size-fits-all. There were also many people who said that they would not use guns indiscriminately. However, there was indeed a period of time where some gun-related crimes were committed because the batch was not turned in and the custodian was not optimistic about it. It is true that most dogs actually Not only does he not bite, he is also afraid of people when he sees them, and he is cautious to the point of being humble. However, just like the Trisolarans cannot see through people&#39;s thoughts, how can humans know the inner thoughts of every dog? It&#39;s over, as long as dog owners have to raise dogs according to the regulations. , it should be tied up and locked up, what is there to be afraid of? If you want to walk your dog without a leash and don&#39;t want to lock it up too much, and at the same time you don&#39;t want law enforcement officers to control it for you, you are quite overbearing, not to mention that it is only a street in the city now. In this way, the countryside is still doing things step by step. Well, I naturally don’t want those dogs that can bite people to be sent to the countryside collectively, because although the dogs in the village are relatively cheap in blood, they are not smart enough. As long as they are free-range with an owner, they will not bite. Humans have also figured out the way to live in the world. They are really different from those noble blood dogs that are pampered and proud of as treasures by their owners. Now they scold the city management and the police, and when their own family members are bitten, they will scold them for not doing anything. They are lazy in politics. , look, the same people will jump out and scold them. So, it is actually very simple. As long as you tie a leash and wear a muzzle when you go out, it will be fine. After all, there is a dog license in the city. Get it according to the regulations, and you are done with wandering. Dog, if you love it, just adopt it, just like Yunliu, right? If a stray dog hurts someone another day, someone will not necessarily jump out and take responsibility. Love is a responsibility, it is not something that can be taken for granted by talking about it. Just like life, after all Let’s return to the simplicity of firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar and tea. We can’t say that it’s love when you pass by to tease and feed two ham sausages, because after that, the dog should continue to dig through the garbage. After that, he will continue to sleep in any corner of the bridge. You can’t change the wandering. The reality of the family, and then you say that you can&#39;t help all stray dogs, and there is nothing wrong with it, but what is the difference between watching the stray dogs you feed running around in the streets and those owners who walk their dogs without leashes? It is worse than human beings, because after the accident you will say that the dog is not yours, but a wild dog, but before the accident, you will say that you love it anyway. This is very complicated, but it is also very simple. If you cannot shoulder the corresponding social responsibility, Just don’t point fingers or even interfere with those who have the power to enforce the law. Love is a responsibility, just like watching a monkey showman reward the monkey. It only gives the monkey food and clothing, but it cannot give the monkey freedom. It doesn’t matter whether it is fed or built a shack. The nature of wandering cannot be changed, and the main activity of wandering will inevitably lead to disputes with other dogs over food, which will frighten people who are afraid of dogs, because there is no fixed place to run around in the streets, and you will encounter dogs that are bigger than yourself. When a child exposes his bestiality, caring people may not appear, right? Just like school bullying, we outside the school, and even the school teachers themselves, cannot tell which classmate loves to bully others, and to what extent they are bullied, but they are bullied. The classmates who bully know that, and similarly, the stray dogs know who is the dominant dog in the area and dare to bite people, but people don&#39;t know. Does that mean that all unleashed and unleashed dogs have to be walked around? Should law enforcement officers treat everyone equally when arresting them? So it’s still the same sentence, you want people not to treat people equally and apply one-size-fits-all, either lock or shut down, don’t set the rhythm with a few words, and then the rules will be messed up. The laws and regulations are written in black and white, and the law enforcement officers are acting according to the rules. There is nothing to question. If you have everything in place, and someone takes the rope and hinge from your hand and then takes the dog away, that is indeed abominable. I support petitioning and complaining. But if not, please first give a key description of the dog&#39;s state when it was caught. Love dogs. It’s okay. I often chat and say hello to dogs on the street. But in the past, I was also afraid of dogs. Naturally, I know the fear of people who are afraid of dogs. Therefore, it is good to understand the relevant regulations. In addition, the scope of dog visits in the village is actually only Near the yard, there is basically a range that will come back when called. The one in Chongzhou, huh, I still look for it. Even if I can’t call it back, I have the nerve to keep it free. I might as well raise local dogs in the village. Of course, I also have a neighbor’s two dogs, one with a leash. One level belongs to Taipi, but in fact, they are the two most unbeatable in the yard, but if the master doesn&#39;t let them out, what is this? Be responsible, and it doesn’t necessarily mean that you two are depressed. Even if those free-range dogs are unhappy when they pass by and tease you, they still should eat and sleep. So in many cases, when the so-called giving freedom to dogs, isn’t it because people are touching themselves? ? When I was a child, my family had a Pomeranian, but I was afraid of dogs. For my sake, I kept the puppy at home for a few months and played with me, because I knew that people are more important than dogs, so I had to think about dogs first. Think about people. If people&#39;s safety cannot be guaranteed and is threatened, then what&#39;s the point of talking about dogs? In the past, China had a hard time living on the line of food and clothing. At that time, let alone eating dog meat, there were all kinds of people who didn’t even dare to think about it. They couldn’t even eat enough. Why do they still love dogs? Hey, now life is better and better. You need to find it. If you have a companion, then love it well and take responsibility. Law enforcement officials must be responsible for everyone from a macro perspective. If there is nothing wrong with your dog, just follow the regulations. If it does not follow the regulations, it will be sold miserably and the rhythm will be exempted.

175,"In fact, the best way to deal with stray dogs is for caring people to take these stray dogs home. Celebrities are not only caring and rich, but they are also willing to spend money to do good deeds and give animals a warm home. This is how they both show their love. It can also take care of animals, and ordinary people will be happy to see it. This way, animals will not wander anymore and there will be no biting problems. As for celebrities, they not only raised problems but also solved them. They didn&#39;t show off at all and actually did great deeds of good deeds. The reason why some people like to talk about stray dogs and say that you don&#39;t have to love them and don&#39;t hurt them is because it doesn&#39;t affect their lives. One day, there are a few stray dogs in groups at the door of his house. How do you see their reaction? Likewise, if you love, then love well! Isn’t the problem of stray dogs caused by owners abandoning them? The correct call is to raise dogs in a civilized way. Don’t abandon them. Once you have them, keep them with you until the end. Be a true dog lover, instead of replacing the dog with a new one when it doesn’t look good, getting tired of it, and then throwing it away and letting it wander. Don’t just be responsible for speaking out and not be responsible for solving problems. If you want a good reputation, take action instead of being a verbal giant.

176,"The incident of dog biting children in Sichuan has developed more and more away from the incident itself. Various new chain reactions caused by this incident have been seen on the Internet: there are mothers who carry hammers when walking their babies for self-defense, and mothers who walk with leashes. Some carry sticks to intimidate dogs to clear the way, some poison puppies under bushes, some use syringes to poison dog and cat food, some campus security guards beat stray dogs to death, and some capture and lock up dogs in cages to guard factory areas. , some imprison large dogs that are not on the list of prohibited dogs, etc. People&#39;s focus on solving problems has gradually become extreme and antagonistic. Overcorrecting will inevitably create new conflicts and incidents. But shouldn’t the essence of the problem be the uncivilized dog-raising behavior and the corresponding groups of people? Why not solve the problem instead of creating it to ferment conflicts and deviate from the essence of the problem? As a dog owner, I support strict education or crackdowns on those who keep dogs in an uncivilized manner. Sometimes we hate those who keep dogs in an uncivilized manner even more than those who hate dogs or are afraid of dogs. But will killing stray dogs on a large scale solve the problem? Does the large-scale imprisonment of large dogs that are not on the prohibited dog list solve the problem? I can still see that in this moment of turmoil, there are still people who rely on the small size of their dogs and the fact that their dogs are not prohibited dogs and they walk without leashes. The reason is that the current handling methods are not based on the nature of this incident. The essence of the problem is people! Those who don&#39;t obey the law! Uncivilized dog owners! But the dog somehow took on everything. The problem of stray dogs itself is a persistent social problem. This incident caused a sensation and a lot of efforts were made to deal with it, but next spring there will be a new batch of stray dogs. The reason is not a human problem! Some people regard raising a dog as a responsibility, educating them from an early age, raising a dog in a civilized manner, and being responsible for the dog; some people regard raising a dog as a kind of fun, and want to throw it away as soon as the novelty wears off or makes people angry. The most important and core way to solve the problem of stray dogs is to put those irresponsible dog owners on the list for rectification. I was walking the dogs this morning, and a child in the distance said to his mother, &quot;There are two dogs.&quot; His expression and tone were pure and happy. Dogs and children are not antagonistic. As parents of children and dog owners, we should educate children and dogs reasonably and provide each other with a safe, harmonious and friendly environment. Dog owners should walk their dogs on leashes, actively intervene and stop certain behaviors of their puppies, and actively avoid children or younger children without guardians present. Parents of children should also guide their children. Although puppies are cute, unfamiliar dogs can be looked at from a distance but should not be too close and do not touch them directly. Parents are not supported in simply instilling in their children the idea that &quot;all dogs bite.&quot; At the same time, we should also stop children from barking, screaming, stamping, and hitting dogs.

200,"Why are people always so selfish? Stray dogs do bring a lot of hidden dangers to human life. I have also seen many stray dogs, one or a group. They never take the initiative to approach humans. There were even times when I wanted to play with them. No one paid any attention to me. How many of those who were bitten did it because they took the initiative and made the dog feel dangerous before they fought back? We shouldn&#39;t kill all stray dogs cruelly. I also want to ask a question, why are there stray dogs? Why are there so many? Because of human abandonment. It is not a choice for puppies to be strays or not. Because of human selfishness, they let them wander and let their children continue to wander. Now, because these stray dogs have harmed humans, we have to selfishly hunt them down. Look at how ridiculous this is. Writing this reminds me of some memories. I used to have a dog, and she was a very well-behaved and domineering little sister. She never harmed anyone on her own initiative. At that time, I really hated having children at home, because the children would always provoke the puppy, scratching its fur and tail. The puppy could only hide, and the children would have to follow the dog if they couldn&#39;t catch it. If you chase her, she will definitely resist, but she will only whine twice or pretend to bite as a warning. Whenever this happens, the puppy will always be scolded or even beaten. I was really speechless😒, and even thought viciously, just bite the child to see if he would dare to provoke the dog like this next time, but then I thought, he is just a child and has no judgment of his own about danger. So every time on this occasion, I will look at my dog, not to be afraid that it will bite, but to stop those who are short-sighted from messing with her, because no matter what the outcome, the dog will always be scolded. Since you have a dog, you must be responsible for this life. Walking the dog on a leash or wearing a muzzle is to protect others and the dog. Whether it’s a pet dog biting someone or a stray dog biting someone, in the final analysis, it’s human irresponsibility that causes all this, isn’t it? I think of a saying that adults often say: Ah, he is just a child, what can he understand, you argue with her. It&#39;s quite morally kidnapping, isn&#39;t it? They are just a bunch of mute dogs, worse than children, no one loves them, no one loves them, they are exposed to wind and rain, most of the time they just want to live, just to protect themselves, what&#39;s wrong with them?

218,"The lesson from this incident is: Don’t pet a dog that is not your own, even if it looks docile and cute. Parents, especially, need to educate their children about this. What should you do if you encounter a vicious dog? Let me talk about my experience. Yesterday, a netizen communicated with me and said: &quot;I am naturally afraid of dogs.&quot; When I see a dog, I get scared and want to hide. In fact, any animal will be naturally timid when it sees other animals that are larger than itself. Ordinary small and medium-sized dogs are more afraid of people. When a dog barks at people, it is a sign of vigilance and self-defense. Moreover, dogs have been domesticated by humans for a long time and are close to humans. At least they basically coexist peacefully. In most cases, dogs do not dare to actively provoke and bite humans... Dogs are highly intelligent animals. They can understand and understand. Human expression. When people get along with dogs, don&#39;t be afraid. There is no need to be afraid. When you see a dog, you should be calm and domineering. If you show timidity, some dogs are &quot;bad&quot; and will bully you. From my experience, when you see a dog, you can look him in the eyes and don’t be timid. When getting along with an unfamiliar dog at close range, do not make any moves that would make the dog mistakenly think that you are going to attack him. This can easily cause the dog to misjudge and attack you &quot;by striking first&quot;. If the dog is not your own, don’t pet it easily, even if it looks very docile and cute. Parents especially need to educate their children about this. If you see a dog barking at you, it may attack you. Stomp your feet, shout, or bend down to pick up something and beat it. If you have other objects in your hand, resolutely defend yourself and wave the object in your hand to calm it down. If you do the above, 99%+ dogs will not dare to bully you. It is particularly worth mentioning that when a person and a dog are in confrontation, do not turn around and run easily. If the person runs first, the dog will naturally catch up and bite. Of course, as a dog owner, you must raise dogs in a civilized manner. If you raise a dog in the city, you cannot raise a violent dog. You must walk the dog on a leash. If you have a dog, you must be responsible for the dog and cannot abandon it casually.

219,"[Afternoon Investigation: From Rottweiler bites to stray dogs being hunted] The incident of a pet Rottweiler biting a two-year-old child in Chengdu, Sichuan, has made dogs in the city the focus of law enforcement agencies in many places, and has also made dogs in the city the focus of many law enforcement agencies. The issue of how humans and animals can coexist has once again become the focus of controversy among Chinese netizens. According to reports from China News Service, Upstream News and other Chinese media, a two-year-old girl was bitten by an unsupervised Rottweiler in a community in Chongzhou City, Chengdu on Monday (October 16). It caused a rupture of the right kidney, abdominal effusion, and multiple skin lacerations on the chest and back. As of now, he is still in a coma. He is being treated in the Children&#39;s ICU of West China Hospital of Sichuan University and his vital signs are stable. A two-year-old girl was seriously injured by an unsupervised Rottweiler in a community in Chongzhou City, Chengdu on Monday (October 16). She is still receiving treatment in the children&#39;s ICU. The picture shows the surveillance footage at the time of the incident. (Internet) The Chongzhou City Joint Investigation Team reported on Tuesday (October 17) that the injurious black Rottweiler ran into the community and bit the girl on the morning of the incident. It was captured at about 10 o&#39;clock that night, and its owner Tang Mou also He arrived at the case early the next morning and was subject to criminal coercive measures in accordance with the law. Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday (October 18), citing the Sichuan Provincial Public Security Department, that Tang had been criminally detained. While praying for the injured girl&#39;s speedy recovery, many Chinese netizens started a heated debate on how to prevent such an incident from happening again. Moderates believe that civilized dog breeding should be promoted, dog management and owners&#39; responsibilities should be standardized, and punishments for owners of injurious pets should be increased, while radicals advocate that pet dog ownership should be restricted on a large scale and stray dogs should be hunted down comprehensively. To avoid future troubles. Due to the tragic cost of the girl&#39;s serious injury and the pressure of public opinion, many places in China have announced to strengthen the management of dog breeding, including grassroots law enforcement agencies carrying out inspections of pet dogs in the region, and punishing those who walk their dogs without leashes and those who keep prohibited dog breeds. , and capture and deal with stray dogs, etc. On Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu, under almost every post about law enforcement agencies punishing illegal dog owners or catching stray dogs, you can see netizens arguing with each other. The core of the debate can be roughly summarized as who is responsible for injuries caused by animals, how to deal with stray animals, and whether the rights of pets are protected. Who is responsible for injuries caused by animals? For pets with owners, this question is easy to answer: According to China&#39;s Civil Code, if a raised animal causes damage to others, the animal owner or manager shall bear tort liability. In the Chengdu Rottweiler injury incident, Zhou Zhaocheng, the victim&#39;s attorney, also issued a statement saying that the case has been filed as a criminal case by the public security organs. The dog owner may be suspected of negligent causing serious injury, or suspected of negligently endangering public safety in dangerous ways. In addition, they will also pursue the tort liability of the property in the community where the incident occurred. However, in many minor incidents where pets hurt people or disturb residents, grassroots law enforcement agencies do not resort to legal action, but instead try to reconcile the two parties with the mentality of &quot;making it a trivial matter.&quot; Although this kind of handling method is more humane, it also leaves many people with the impression that dog owners are confident and will not take responsibility. The human touch has also become a dilemma for many local grassroots departments when implementing local dog management regulations. Rottweilers are large dogs that can weigh more than 50 kilograms. They are often used as guard dogs and police dogs because of their high vigilance and aggressiveness. Rottweilers are banned in Mianyang, Sichuan, but are not banned in Chengdu (Internet) Since there are no unified national regulations, most dog breeding management regulations in China are formulated by cities, or even provinces. Differences arise: For example, Rottweiler is a banned dog breed in Mianyang, Sichuan, but not banned in Chengdu. Therefore, despite the regulations, it is not easy for grassroots law enforcement officers to persuade owners to give up their dogs that they have kept for many years and can be kept in the next city. Due to the difficult situation, coupled with the large number of dog owners, the difficulty and cost of law enforcement to investigate one by one are too high. In many cases, the relevant departments turn a blind eye to dog breeds that are outside the regulations. As for punishments for uncivilized behaviors such as not picking up feces and walking dogs without leashes, they are often in vain due to factors such as difficulty in supervision and light punishment. The loose management in the past also led to more obstacles when officials wanted to strictly enforce it. For example, this week a community in Xi&#39;an proposed a house-to-house cleanup of banned dogs, and Henan law enforcement officers arrested banned pet French bulldogs on the streets, which aroused the dissatisfaction of many netizens. Henan law enforcement officers arrested banned pet French bulldogs on the streets, causing dissatisfaction among many netizens. (Internet) How to deal with stray animals? Although there is some evidence to support the accountability of owned pets for injuring people, it is difficult to hold accountable stray animals for injuring people in cities: Although the law stipulates that the original owners of abandoned pets who injure people are responsible, and those who feed stray animals for a long time must also bear certain responsibilities, but in actual practice It&#39;s almost impossible to get up. Therefore, once relevant disputes arise and attract attention, the grassroots approach in many places in China is to kill stray animals on a large scale in the area. However, such a one-size-fits-all approach to law enforcement is not only unacceptable to animal rights activists, but also makes netizens question why &quot;one dog makes a mistake and all dogs sit down together.&quot; According to a 2021 report from China&#39;s state-run media CCTV News, approximately 40 million people in China are bitten by cats and dogs every year, many of which are caused by stray animals. However, it is difficult for public opinion to reach a consensus on the issue of which is more important, the survival rights of stray animals and the safety of the people. For example, after the security guards of Chongqing University of International Business and Economics captured and killed a stray dog on campus on Tuesday, a large number of students were dissatisfied. The school also suspended the dog on Friday (October 20) on the grounds of &quot;improper behavior during the disposal process.&quot; Security guard suspended. Students of Chongqing University of International Business and Economics laid flowers in memory of the dead stray dog &quot;Xiao Huang&quot; on campus. (Internet) There are no winners in this incident: the stray dog lost its life, the dissatisfied students no longer trust the school, and the suspended security guard is also very unjust in the eyes of netizens who support vigorous control of stray animals. In addition to students and ordinary netizens, there are also Chinese celebrities who end up fighting for stray dogs. Among them, Hong Kong Academy Award-winning actress Liu Yase posted on Weibo on Friday that &quot;not all stray dogs are bad dogs&quot; and called for &quot;stop killing animals.&quot; Comedian Yang Di also posted a video on Douyin on the same day, condemning the owner&#39;s behavior of not keeping a leash in the Chengdu Rottweiler incident, and calling on everyone to &quot;don&#39;t like dogs, but please don&#39;t hurt them.&quot; One thing the two artists have in common is that they are both dog owners. Are pets’ rights protected? Having compassion for stray animals is not only out of respect for life. For many pet owners, it may also be because they are worried that one-size-fits-all treatment methods such as killing will one day be adopted for their pets. This is not without precedent. During the COVID-19 epidemic, from 2021 to 2022, from the third-tier cities of Jiangxi Shangrao and Hebei Langfang to the metropolitan Shanghai, pet cats and dogs were &quot;sterilized&quot; and &quot;harmlessly disposed&quot; on the grounds of epidemic prevention. Although Each time it aroused public outrage, but in the end it was ignored. In addition, although it was not implemented in the end, Shijiazhuang issued a document requiring that negative dogs be sent away, all positive dogs and stray dogs be killed, and a complete ban on dog breeding in the area for three years, on the grounds of preventing &quot;Kala-azar&quot;. The mainstream view is that the lack of animal protection laws is the core reason for these chaos and the fear of more than 67 million pet owners in China. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Chinese non-governmental organizations, legal experts and National People&#39;s Congress representatives have repeatedly proposed that an animal protection law covering pets and urban animals should be established, but so far there has been no progress in relevant legislation. When experts proposed a draft proposal for an animal protection law in 2009, China Youth Daily wrote an article saying that due to China’s complex national conditions and uneven development, “code-based animal protection laws should be slowed down in China”; more than ten years later, in 2023 When &quot;China Environment News&quot; quoted legal experts commenting on why animal protection laws are difficult to establish, they still emphasized the need to &quot;appropriately take into account local customs while conforming to national conditions.&quot; Although legislative protection cannot eliminate conflicts between animals and people, and countries with relevant laws often cause dissatisfaction due to the legal handling of individual cases, for animal protectionists and pet owners, as well as grassroots law enforcement officers, if there are upper-level laws Providing protection and guidance will surely reduce a lot of trouble. On the other hand, if relevant laws and regulations are not perfected, it will also have a big impact on the currently booming pet “it economy”. China&#39;s pet consumption market has been booming in recent years, and some consulting organizations predict that it may exceed one trillion yuan in five years. The picture shows pet cats on display at the 2023 Tianjin International Pet Industry Expo. (China News Service) According to the &quot;2023 China Pet Content Value Research White Paper&quot; released by iResearch in April, the scale of China&#39;s pet consumption market in 2022 will be approximately 311.7 billion yuan (RMB, the same below, approximately S$59 billion). The agency predicts that as pet household penetration and industry maturity continue to increase, the pet consumer market will continue to grow in the future. The market size is expected to be approximately 392.4 billion yuan in 2023 and may reach 811.4 billion yuan in 2025. In the next five years, It is expected to exceed one trillion within this year. As China solves the problem of food and clothing and moves into a moderately prosperous society, the number of people keeping pets continues to increase, and people&#39;s emotional sustenance for pets is also increasing day by day. But if this group’s needs for a sense of security and transparency of rules cannot be taken seriously and met, I am afraid that more conflicts will be intensified in the future.

221,"A banned and violent dog bit someone. First of all, I sympathize with the little girl. Secondly, I strongly condemn the dog owner’s uncivilized dog-raising behavior! Social attention is getting higher and higher, and public opinion is becoming more and more fierce. All people who usually don&#39;t like cats and dogs are beginning to have a climax. As if they are grasping a life-saving straw, they start to preach about a total ban on dog breeding, and about killing all stray dogs... ZFs across the country have also begun to make various efforts to improve performance and order the killing of all stray dogs... The consistent style of the Chinese ZF is the same as not treating pets as life during the epidemic, because they only bully the weak and adopt a one-size-fits-all management style. What makes me unable to see the end of the light is growing more and more disappointed with this society. What&#39;s wrong with stray dogs? They spend their whole life trying to live. They go hungry and eat every meal. Most of them hide from people to survive. This incident was caused by uncivilized dog keeping from beginning to end. Why don’t we introduce policies to manage dog owners? As a dog owner myself, I am responsible for myself, others and the dog by always keeping a leash when going out. Behavior! What problems can be solved by blindly killing people across the board? What a pity for those innocent lives. Animals are man&#39;s best friends.

236,"Tell me something serious. For all social issues, before discussing whether it should be done or not, we must first discuss who will pay for it. Discussions about whether something should be done or not often turn into empty moral debates. But if we discuss who should pay the bill, we can often find the answer quickly based on reality. This principle is particularly applicable to politically correct issues such as women&#39;s rights, animal welfare, and environmental protection. For example, the topic of these two days. A lot of people are debating whether to protect the rights of stray dogs, but the real practical discussion should be, if the rights of stray dogs are to be protected, who will pay the bill? For example, in many people&#39;s minds, Germany is the model for animal protection, right? How does their animal protection law protect the rights of pets, and who pays the bill? Their idea is that the best way to get rid of stray dogs is to prevent their owners from abandoning them as a rule. &quot;Germany&#39;s Animal Protection Law emphasizes that it is illegal to abandon pet dogs at will. Once discovered, the fine can be up to 90,000 euros (approximately RMB 680,000).&quot; What should you do if you say you can&#39;t pay the fine? It doesn&#39;t matter, I have been on guard against this trick for a long time. All dog owners must pay pet insurance similar to compulsory traffic insurance. The amount is USD 250/year (2020 data). You see, now it becomes clear who will pay for pet rights? It&#39;s not a slogan or a quarrel on the Internet - it&#39;s all pet owners footing the bill through compulsory payment of taxes and fees. So when you talk about how good a foreign country is, don’t just look at what they do well, but also look at what they pay for behind the scenes. Wool comes from sheep, and foreign pet dog-related rights and interests are based on pet-related taxes and insurance. If you ask all domestic pet owners to pay 1,500 yuan per year for compulsory traffic insurance, and use this money to pay compensation and protect their rights and interests, many problems can be solved. The number of car accidents in China every year is not a small number, so why is there not much debate online? Everyone has insurance and the compensation is covered, so naturally they are too lazy to argue. Therefore, I suggest that everyone should not engage in empty moral debates on the issue of animal protection. Since they keep saying that Germany does a good job in animal protection, and there is protection here and protection there, then we should study it systematically and holistically. We need to learn not only about the protection of people’s rights, but also about the payment of fees. It’s not like, “I want pet rights protection abroad. If you don’t provide it, you will become a backward and decadent uncivilized country without learning.” “But you want to ask for payment regulations for pets abroad. This is obviously what society should provide. How can you be so embarrassed? You want money!&quot; Just rights, no obligations, right?

The earth belongs not only to humans but also to all species living on this planet, whether we like or fear us. Recently, we often see videos about banned dogs and some stray puppies. The news of the killing makes me very, very sad, and I am very reluctant to see the video. Not every puppy is a puppy that will attack people, and not all puppies are puppies that can hurt people. It’s just that ...Puppies can&#39;t talk, or puppies have words, but we can&#39;t understand them. If puppies can talk, then I think the biting Rottweiler might want to say: &quot;No...I didn&#39;t talk first! It was the little girl.&quot; You hurt me first! My feet are bleeding...I will feel pain...I am also scared...I just want to protect myself.&quot; Here I am not saying that Rottweiler is not at fault, but I think the biggest fault is raising Rottweiler. Na&#39;s owner, when you raise this dog, you must be prepared to take care of it for a lifetime. This is responsible for yourself and the dog. I write this... I can&#39;t express the rest of the words. I hope everyone Can you all be kind to small animals? All lives in this world have their own meaning.

241,"I&#39;ve seen too many incidents of stray dogs being killed recently, which is so depressing. It&#39;s people who want to keep dogs, people who don&#39;t leash them, and people who abandon dogs. Don’t people really need to reflect? I don’t think so, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many people clamoring about killing all stray cats and dogs, so that those who abuse animals have such an excuse, and you will be very happy when you eat cat and dog meat. Bar. I don’t keep a dog, because I know that once I get a dog, I will sow the seeds of sadness. My parents have taught me since I was a child not to touch the dog casually, and not to run away, just walk over slowly, and never look at each other. . Now that I have grown up, when I see other people raising dogs, I just watch them from a distance. When I meet them, I will ask if I can pet them. The sanitation workers around my house adopted three puppies. They were very dear to me. They didn&#39;t bark, and even when I cleaned with them, I would leave some food for them to eat. However, they were still poisoned to death by others in the end, very quickly. Ten minutes passed... Where did the stray cats and dogs come from? When people see cute cats and dogs, they clamor to get one. Later, they find it troublesome and throw them away at will. Unneutered cats and dogs will only continue to reproduce, so there will be more and more. If they meet kind-hearted people, they can adopt them. If not, they can only wander around. They don’t know what their future destiny will be, and they won’t know that they will be homeless in the future. They don’t want to. They only know that they are alive, and they are home wherever they are. , in the grass, with broken cardboard boxes, anywhere they can lie down and sleep temporarily is their home. They are cautious and will hide away from humans when they see them. They can survive by digging through the trash cans and finding something to eat. I don’t know whether to call them stupid or stupid. It&#39;s human nature. If you give him some food, he will be eager to follow you. If you give him food today, he will be here waiting for you tomorrow. Their life is so simple, but he will really remember everyone who is good to them. Since you decide to keep a dog, you must be responsible instead of just saying it. Not everyone is suitable for raising a dog. Raise your dog in a civilized way, keep it on a leash when going out, and wear a crate with a mouth. Even if your dog doesn’t bite, wearing it will prevent the dog from eating randomly. Why not? Dogs have to pick up their poop everywhere. Those who don&#39;t like dogs will always use this to hate dogs. Parents should also educate their children not to tease dogs. If a dog walks away, don’t look at it, and don’t throw things. If you don’t mess with me, I won’t mess with you. I don’t believe you don’t understand this. Now I feel more helpless. I can&#39;t do anything. I feel like everyone is going crazy and are furious. The stray dogs will have their own home in the next life...

Then I saw stray cats and dogs being caught all over the country. I remembered that there are scenes in foreign dramas where stray cats and dogs are caught and injected with euthanasia. I had some doubts, but I thought that in China, they would definitely be caught and raised together. But today I saw again that if stray dogs bite people, long-term feeders are responsible. It feels like it is already 2023 and there is such an unreasonable decision.

257,"I wasn&#39;t afraid of dogs when I was a kid, but after I was chased by a dog in third grade and almost caught up with me, I developed a physical fear of dogs, which some people may find difficult to understand. I remember very clearly afterwards that our landlord had a dog that liked to get close to people. Regardless of whether it would bite people or not, I showed that I was scared. The landlord was still smiling and talking. I really can’t forget it. That scene, such a narrow stairwell and a dog without a leash, I later took a detour when I saw the dog. When a dog barks, I stay far away. Many people are afraid of dogs. I don’t care what others think about dogs that are not on leashes. I think they should not be seen in front of people. I think it would be irresponsible if no one takes responsibility for dogs biting people but fails to take supervision measures. Yes, stray dogs and cats are a life, but people are also lives. Activities in their respective venues are respectful to both parties. Some dogs can even break free even if they are tied up. When I encounter a leashed dog on the road, I also take a detour. I have a natural affinity for people who pull the dog&#39;s leash to make way for me. It&#39;s like when boys and girls go together at night, and the boys pretend to call and be humble to the girls, and avoid being with the girls. I think some things need to be put into perspective. Many times conflicts arise from imperfect systems and people’s lack of understanding of the issues. Although I am speaking from my own perspective, I cannot come up with a very complete plan.

On the contrary, whenever such an incident occurs, it is known that it must be managed and arrested and killed. Is this your management plan? Why did you go so early? Ninety percent of the stray dogs in the country are abandoned dogs. Are stray dogs born to be strays? Are they born to be hungry, cold and without shelter? There is a cycle of cause and effect. If there is no abandonment, there will be no stray dogs. If there is no threshold for raising a dog, tragedies will continue to happen. If you buy a dog at a low price and keep it for a week or two, you will feel that the dog is not good. If you don’t educate it, you will throw it away or even kill it. This is reason!

284,"Morgan Stanley: The 60/40 stock and bond investment strategy may regain its strength. Compared with the historical levels of various asset classes, fixed income products are currently particularly cheap compared to stocks. On the basis of foreign exchange hedging, European and Japanese Stocks are cheaper than most other assets, and euro-denominated assets are cheaper than dollar-denominated assets. Morgan Stanley pointed out that in this context, the traditional 60/40 investment portfolio (that is, a moderately risky combination of 60% stocks and 40% bonds) may once again become a viable strategy. In fact, fixed income is currently particularly cheap compared to equities relative to historical levels across asset classes. On a FX-hedged basis, European and Japanese stocks are cheaper than most other assets, while euro-denominated assets are cheaper than dollar-denominated assets. Additionally, our estimates of optimal allocations to agency mortgage-backed securities have increased over the past year, while allocations to investment-grade credit have declined correspondingly, reflecting the fact that mortgages are more valuable to other markets Advantage. Against this backdrop, the traditional 60/40 portfolio (a moderately risky mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds) may once again become a viable strategy after both stocks and bonds were hit by record inflation and aggressive economic growth in 2022. The drag of rising interest rates has led to poor performance of the 60/40 portfolio. It now appears that with long-term expected returns for most assets soaring, the $60/40 portfolio&#39;s expected average annual return over the next 10 years is expected to increase to 8%, having last hit this high in 2013 . At the same time, the average annual return on the 60/40 euro portfolio is likely to reach 7.7% over the next 10 years, a new high since 2011. Although long-term expected returns have picked up, the stock-bond correlation is already high for the 60/40 strategy. We continue to believe that a 60/40 portfolio is helpful in diversifying risk and smoothing volatility, primarily due to the low-risk nature of bonds rather than their low correlation with equities, which is exacerbated by increased bond volatility. kind of worry. The question that has attracted much attention is whether the high correlation between stocks and bonds will return to normal. There is a school of thought that says not, and perhaps surprisingly, a school of thought that says it’s all about artificial intelligence. Over the past 30 years, the positive correlation between economic growth and inflation has been an important factor in the negative correlation between stocks and bonds. Rising inflation erodes bond returns, while rising stock returns from economic growth offset falling bond returns, and vice versa. But in the context of the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technology, we could see an economic boost and lower inflation in the short term, which poses a threat to the assumption that stock and bond returns will show low or negative correlation in the future. In other words, as has been the case this year, bonds will no longer be the great diversifier they have been for the past 30 years.

285,"A-shares: Don’t miss this opportunity, the number one humanoid “robot” has been dormant for 3 years! It is expected that you can read Lao Chen’s articles and learn logical thinking from 9 yuan to 60 yuan! There is no shortage of miracles in this market. We have also witnessed a miracle. There is also an index in the big A market that can rise by 12% in one day. Although almost no one participates, it can be regarded as a witness. This is money driven. Many people think that the market relies on policies, news, technology, and fundamentals. In fact, the most fundamental thing is: funds! Everyone should know that news, policies, company fundamentals, technical analysis, market confidence, etc. are only foreign investment factors that affect the entry of funds, not the intrinsic nature! There can be no news or policy in the market. No matter how unfavorable you are about the company, as long as the money is in place, the stock price will definitely rise. Even if you are optimistic about a company and can compile a lot of reasons for being optimistic about it, if you don&#39;t have enough money, it will definitely not grow! In Lao Chen’s view: Capital &gt; News &gt; Policy &gt; Fundamentals &gt; Technical analysis. Why we are optimistic about humanoid “robots” Recently, the humanoid robot industry has been making frequent moves. Leju and Shenzhen Kaihong Robotics launched the first KaihongOS humanoid robot based on the open source Hongmeng. Tesla has also increased its humanoid robot layout, especially in terms of talent, adding multiple related positions. Why are major companies increasing their deployment of humanoid robots? This has to be considered from the perspective of software and hardware. It is an important time node in the industrialization process of humanoid robots, and humanoid robots are the intersection of major technological breakthroughs. Whether it is the iterative upgrade of precision control component solutions or the continuous progress of GPT large models, the &quot;dawn moment&quot; of humanoid robot industrialization is one step closer. Humanoid robots are also the realization of intelligent and technological applications. It is estimated that the market space of humanoid robots is expected to reach 154 billion US dollars in 2035, far exceeding electric vehicles. Lao Chen also compiled several companies in the humanoid &quot;robot&quot; sector that can be collected and studied, especially the last one that has been dormant for 3 years! Price-to-earnings ratio: 22.52, expected to range from 9 yuan to 60 yuan. Time will prove Lao Chen’s judgment, let’s take a look. 1. Saiwei Intelligent has service robots in artificial intelligence. It has established the &quot;Sawei-Osaka University Health Strategy Research Institute&quot; with Osaka University, focusing on the development of health service robots, including light and small wearable devices, exoskeletons, intelligent nursing beds, etc. Series of products; 2.

287,"tyj Tianyingju November 22, 2023 09:06 The Ji family was rich in Zhou Gong, and Qiu also gathered and benefited from it. Confucius said: &quot;I am not a disciple, but a boy can beat the drum and attack.&quot; 09:07 Looking back at yesterday&#39;s market, the turnover of the two cities was 998.1 billion, with a month-on-month increase of 70.7 billion. The offshore RMB depreciation repaired and returned to near the 7.1 mark, and a large amount of capital inflow impacted the Beijing Stock Exchange market. The Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock indexes followed the trend and opened higher, while the three major A-share indexes all rose higher and fell back, fluctuating slightly and turning green. On the market, the opening of heavyweight stocks such as real estate and consumption drove the relevant sectors to rise higher, stabilizing and pushing the market index to new highs. Furniture and supplies, food and beverages, hotels and restaurants, large financial insurance banks and securities, radio and television, short drama games, diamonds Also rotate performance. Chiplets, electronic chemicals, Huawei-related, robots, etc. were among the top adjusters. At midday closing, the North Exchange North Securities 50 Index rose by more than 8%, and 231 North Exchange stocks rose wildly. Under the divergence of funds, the overall market of Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange was dragged down by the overall shock in the afternoon. 09:28 Yesterday’s performance in the afternoon was somewhat anticlimactic, and individual stocks also fell significantly. Stocks with strong themes in the early stage experienced major adjustments. When such a trend occurs, we must be more cautious, especially for high-priced stocks, we must pay attention to gradually falling into pockets, and breaking the trend line Individual stocks with moving averages or moving averages should also pay attention to lightening up their positions. The market encountered resistance at the 55-day moving average of 3078 and failed to break through the two shocks, forming an N-shaped sideways box. Fortunately, the 13-day moving average, the 21-day moving average, and the 34-day moving average have all formed upward support, so the sideways box is There is strong support at the bottom of the box 09:31 We can see that the 144-hour moving average intersects with the 55-hour moving average and disperses after 3049. The 30-minute 89T moving average 3055 and the 144 line 3042 have strong support. The weekly line has been climbing for five consecutive weeks. The 377-week moving average is 3165; the monthly line is quite good. 09:35 The Shanghai stock market call auction is 2.90 billion, and the GEM call auction is 2 billion. The opening volume has shrunk slightly, the market index has opened slightly lower, and the Shenzhen Component Index and the Science and Technology Innovation Board index have paid attention to the gap. of reply. 09:41 &quot;Tianyingju&#39;s stock trading rules summarize the relationship between the three lunar solar terms and the stock market&quot; In 2020, it rose before the light snow, and continued to rise for five days before reaching the top of the box; in 2019, it fell before the light snow, and continued to fall for five days before starting to rise sharply; in 2018, the light snow ended Wave 1 rose and began to fall back in wave 2; in 2017, the light snow ended a period of slow bullishness and then began to fall; in 2016, the light snow rose for five days and then began to fall sharply; in 2015, after the light snow, it ended a long rise for three days and began to fall sharply; in 2014, the light snow The slow bull ended and the crazy bull began; in 2013, it became the second highest point after five days of light snow, and then fell sharply. Therefore, the Xiaoxue solar term is often near the sub-high point (sub-low point), ending a large band and then starting a new large band, which is near a more important turning point. 09:52According to last year’s plan, it would increase for 34 days from the starting line of the bull market to December 7, the heavy snow solar term. Therefore, it is also in line with the rules for the 55-day moving average to adjust when it encounters resistance after rising for 21 days on November 21. After the adjustment, try to stand firm at 3078 for the third time. At 09:55, the morning market opened low and then stepped back downwards. The 5, 8, and 13-day moving averages of the daily line are intensive and evenly divergent upward to form a resonance support, and the market will step back to the support level in time. Then it is recycled upward. After the short-term resistance near the 55-day moving average has been digested twice, the probability of another successful breakthrough is high. 10:11 Today’s opening pattern of increases is almost the same as yesterday’s. In the rotation of technology direction differentiation, the top risers are basically the ones in the lower right corner. The top losers are those that have accelerated in the short term. Tianwei Video drives the short-term skits. The mood of the game and the continuous rotation of themes under the faucet are demonstrations. The recent hot spots are not very good in a sustained manner, so we should pay attention to the risk of rotation. 10:22 Although technology stocks have diverged in the past three days, the logic of the leading sectors is very clear. This logic has lasted for a year and a month! Those are the four varieties that the major investors opened positions for the first time on October 12, 2022: Xinchuang, State-owned Assets Cloud, electronic ID cards, and smart government affairs. According to the practice of previous years, after two years of large-cap stocks rising, theme stocks have risen a year and a half. Now technology stocks have been rising for a year and a month, so they need to sell higher in the last few months. 10:34 Judging from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index, it is still strong today. If the market was weak in the past, it will open lower and counterattack today. But the market It is still running strongly. Judging from the digestion of the upward move to the 55-day moving average, for many consecutive trading days, the 21-day moving average support has not been touched, and it will be withdrawn when it is close. Under the escort of weight, the market digested and switched high-level sectors. This rhythm has been maintained since 2923, and the seesaw rotation performance returned after the switch. 10:41 Heavenly friends can see that from October 12, 2022 to now, the state-owned assets cloud has increased by 90%, smart government has increased by 70%, Xinchuang has increased by 60%, and electronic identity The stock price increased by 50%. These are the top four in the volume rankings on October 12 and November 1, 2022. Of course, after these four technology sectors were established by major players, other major players followed suit, such as Huawei Hongmeng, intellectual property, reducers, Eastern Digital and Western Computing, human brain engineering, operating systems, and artificial intelligence, causing the second and third waves. rise. But the main force at the beginning is always the absolute king who has led the team for more than a year. So follow the main force and have meat to eat! At 10:48, the trading volume of the two cities shrank in the first hour. Yesterday, the use of blue chip weights to attack the 55-day moving average failed, and the index returned to rest. The index does not necessarily have to be strong. Like yesterday, when the index rose, in fact, the theme sectors were all there. Adjustment, the market&#39;s opportunity to make money is not good, but there are two legs of the bull market, always give the other leg a chance to perform, and keep a calm mind. 10:59 The increase in the RMB exchange rate has promoted the recovery of consumption. Although the weight performance has fluctuated to a certain extent, the segmentation direction has continued to show. Next, we still have to look at the economic data. Sanbaishuo initially followed the expectations of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders, which belonged to foreign trade. However, the exchange rate rise the day before yesterday afternoon was the biggest boost and also led to the sentiment in this regard. Keep observing. At 11:03, the market adjusted at the 21-day node. According to the plan, this rebound should last 34 days, so it can only be treated as a short-term adjustment at present. At the very least, the sideways box bottom should be treated according to the movement of the box. Only when the position is broken can we defend. At 11:09, the Science and Technology Innovation Board Index closed the gap, and the Shenzhen Component Index almost closed the gap. Closing the gap is not a bad thing. To save money and always worry about the gap problem, there is not much room for index adjustment, but individual stocks must pay attention to switching between high and low. Once the high tide ebbs, the short-term adjustment range will be scary. 11:12 We can see that whether it is state-owned assets cloud, smart government affairs, or later telecom operations, data confirmation, and short drama games, they continue to rise against the trend. Objectively, there are opportunities, so technology stocks are still at 5 The daily moving average is used as a stop loss line. Continue to hold shares online. Only after breaking the 5-day moving average at 11:23 did yesterday&#39;s article mention that the three waves of rise starting from November 10 have gone out of the band rise structure. &quot;They are all small K lines.&quot; Pull up for a while to near the resistance level, wash the market for a while and then go up again. Now we have walked out of the 3-wave rising structure. Refer to the previous wave of 5 rising bands. Then after stepping back, we have to continue to go up to complete the 3-wave small 5-wave. Structure.&quot; Yesterday&#39;s short-term retracement was still in the range of 3 small waves. If it fails to recover in time today, it will most likely go into a 4 small wave adjustment. Refer to the previous small 2-wave washout, which is near the 55-hour moving average. Therefore, today&#39;s time-sharing defense of the 55-hour moving average is still in the midst of a small-level washout. At 11:27, the market reached near the bottom of the box, and the differentiation of technology stocks caused some technology stocks to continue to rise while others fell. For technology stocks that are above the 5-day moving average, continue to hold, and for stocks that break the 5-day moving average, stop losses and call out. In order to make up for the divergence and adjustment of technology stocks, defensive sectors such as real estate, brewing, agriculture, tourism, hotels and transportation have taken up their positions in a timely manner today. However, the sustainability of these sectors is not good and is far less popular than technology stocks. Therefore, the current market situation is not good, and we still need to pay attention to the risk of individual stocks breaking out. At 11:30, we looked at the market trend in November last year. It also failed after encountering the pressure of the 55-day moving average. The second attempt failed to break through and there was no obvious retreat. The third time came. The root Yang line confirms the breakthrough. Then, after the 144-day moving average was expected to be digested, the adjustment was completed and a wave of main rise repairs started. Similarly, when the moving average pressure is exceeded, the rebound has sufficient energy and the adjustment shrinkage has not significantly retreated, so patience is also required. The current appreciation of the RMB is consistent with the rebound from the depreciation of 7.37 last year. So there is no reason to be overly concerned. Wait patiently for the high and low switching of the disk to complete. As of noon at 12:56, the turnover of the two cities was 544.1 billion, a month-on-month decrease of 84 billion. The three major Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange indexes opened lower and fluctuated. The GEM and Science and Technology Innovation 50 also closed the gap after the Shanghai Stock Index closed the jump gap, and the Shenzhen Component Index was not far from closing the gap. The BSE 50 Index rose again by more than 5%. Since the 21-day moving averages of the three markets have moved upward, the short-term Shanghai Stock Index is relatively resistant to weight performance. In terms of sectors, radio and television, online travel, short drama games, commercial department stores, data verification, smart government affairs, real estate, pork, telecommunications operations, etc. have experienced rotational gains. Energy metals, AI chips, robot actuators, Xiaomi cars, CPO, reducers, automotive integrated die-casting, lithium mines, BC batteries, home furnishings, etc. fell. In the morning, the central parity rate of RMB against the US dollar rose by 152 points to 7.1254, the highest level since June 19. The market&#39;s focus stock Sanbaishuo once again staged a groundbreaking performance. 12:59 The Beijing Stock Exchange 50 continues to rise against the trend. It is said that securities companies are actively promoting the opening of accounts on the North Exchange. The opening rate of the North Exchange&#39;s authority will reach 80% by the end of the year, and will be included in assessment indicators, internal branch rankings, etc., probably in September. , those who have opened the Science and Technology Innovation Board can open the Beijing Stock Exchange with one click. It is very likely that those who hyped 20CM at the beginning and those who are now speculating on 30CM are the same group of people. Xiaosan basically just watched the show, Beijing Stock Exchange, and now speculates The crazy stage of extreme emotional interpretation, but midday may be similar to yesterday. At 13:00, when the market encountered resistance against the 55-day moving average for the second time, it happened to be the point when the market rose to the 21-day mark, so it was another three days of adjustment. Since it was expected to continue rising after firming at 3078, when it failed to firm at 3078 yesterday, short-term hopes were dashed, leading to double disappointment. We still have to control our emotions. Anyway, we hold stocks above the 5-day moving average. If individual stocks break the 5-day moving average, we will call out at 13:08. Judging from the market index today, it is continuing to adjust, individual stocks are diverging, and more than 1,800 stocks have risen. , 51 companies hit the daily limit. From the perspective of market trends, the index has been fluctuating. After constructing a short-term box, you need to look at the direction selection, because the triangle convergence is getting thinner and thinner, and it is approaching the selection node. It is also in line with expectations that there will be an adjustment after the time is close to the 89-hour rising mark. Compared with the market situation in November last year, there was no obvious retreat after encountering the pressure of the 55-day moving average. The third positive line came to confirm the breakthrough, and then gradually started to restore expectations. Therefore, in the short term, if it is still oscillating between the 21-day moving average and the 55-day moving average and has not retreated, watch for a breakthrough in the direction. In the morning, the GEM led the decline, but it was still the Quan Renewable Energy that was holding back. After covering the gap, the short-term break of the 21-day moving average depends on the recovery situation. Judging from the direction that can drive an upward breakthrough on the market, short-term opportunities are still waiting for big technology to regain confidence after the market washout. The Shenzhen state-owned assets concept involved in the Honor backdoor concept has heated up. In addition, large weight is also an important driver of breakthroughs. It also depends on whether it can help after digestion. After the three markets close the gap, the steps will be consistent. At 13:13 in the morning, the index retreated downward to continue the washout after yesterday&#39;s surge, and the space retreated to the position where the 13-day moving average and the 55-hour moving average resonate intensively. The 21-day moving average and the 34-day moving average on the daily line form a resonance block below. Therefore, the room for correction will not be too large, and it is still a small-level adjustment cycle on the way up. 13:27 The market index fluctuated repeatedly at the 55-day moving average. The Shanghai Stock Exchange&#39;s trading volume in the morning did not exceed 200 billion and the shrinkage was obvious. Yesterday&#39;s use of blue-chip weights to attack the 55-day moving average failed. In the short term, reshuffling is brewing. At this time, you should pay attention to your positions and don&#39;t go too far. Advance aggressively and buy low. 13:45 Regarding the current adjustment, we judge that it is a washout on the way up to December 7 after stepping back on the starting line of the bull market. Because the washout intensity after the 21-day node resonates with the 55-day moving average, we refer to the previous three days. Or the five-day sideways fluctuation is mainly: the 13-day moving average is adjusted for three days when it encounters resistance on October 27, the 21-day moving average is adjusted for three days when it encounters resistance on November 1, and the 34-day moving average is adjusted for five days when it encounters resistance on November 7 at 14:01 The Shenzhen Component Index began to cover the gap downward, but it was just a little short of completely covering the gap. It swayed and whirred and finally had to cover. Most of the short-term technology stocks have corrected, but the center of gravity at the low level is basically not there. Move down and continue to wait patiently for the high-low switch after filling the gap. In addition, if the trend support and important moving average support of the individual stocks in your hand have not broken, be more patient. On the hourly line at 14:10, the index fell below the 55-hour moving average and headed downward. The rhythm is similar to the rhythm of the previous wave of retracement. It is about to reach the lower area of the channel and observe whether the decline has stabilized. At 14:23, it hit the line and fell for three days. This has become the basic rule in the last 21 trading days. Yesterday, I expected to stand firm at 3078, but it turned out to be clouds and rain. I failed to stand firm and faced three days of adjustments. I was very disappointed. . But objectively speaking, it is not that pessimistic. After all, there are variables in the sideways box. The two-and-a-half node position at 14:32, the space returns to the lower part of the channel and resonates with the 144-hour moving average. Time and space Basically satisfied. Next, continue to observe the stabilization of the index. 14:41 Both the early trading and the intraday trading showed that yesterday&#39;s attack on the 55-day moving average using blue chip weights was unsuccessful, and the index will be adjusted in the short term. However, individual stocks plunged significantly yesterday afternoon, and the theme sentiment votes rose sharply and fell significantly. At this stage, we must pay attention to position allocation and control. , after high-level stocks break out, you should sell out, and then observe the opportunities of low-level stocks, and do not rush into chasing the rise in the short term. 14:53 Currently, the 15-minute level, 5-minute level and 1-minute level are in a breaking position below the 144 line, but the 30-minute level 144 line 3044, the 144-hour moving average 3046 and the 21-day moving average 3038 have not broken the position yet. Tomorrow is a more important day. It will be observed tomorrow whether it can stop the decline or continue to break the position, and then there must be corresponding operations. At 14:59, the Shanghai Index is still adjusting to the 21-day moving average, and the Shenzhen Component Index and the ChiNext have broken the position in the short term, so it is also It depends on the recovery status of their two markets, the index will go up. Those two markets cannot hold us back. After the differentiation of science and technology, funds tried large consumption and weighting, but because they had a lot of chips on the top after a long-term decline, they will also encounter pressure once repaired. Therefore, for the market to stabilize, it still needs the continuation of policies and a stronger direction to stand out. Just fine. That’s it for today’s live broadcast at 15:00, thank you everyone!

289,"Wednesday&#39;s summary of stock reviews from big V&#39;s analysis of tomorrow&#39;s trend tomorrow predicts a rise or fall ratio of 5:41. Liu Changsong: Looking at the shock position tomorrow, this position is a retracement in the rising structure, so every retracement is an opportunity. In the short term, first look at 3200 points. If you hold stocks below 3700 points and wait for the rise, the weekly line will fluctuate upward. Today it is close to the 5-week moving average. Therefore, this area near the 5-week moving average is an opportunity rather than a risk. It is still recommended to hold patiently and wait. rise. 2. Stock hero Zhong Chao: Tomorrow will be bearish. Now, a very critical issue has arisen in the entire capital market. That is, even if good news drives these big financial heavyweights, they will not rise. The market will soon start a second correction. Whether it can stand firm at 2923 points is a key question. But I must remind everyone not to operate with more than 50% of the position. 3. Orangutans from the stock market: It will be bullish tomorrow. The current Shenzhen Component Index and ChiNext Index have obviously entered the next time window for market changes. Since the short jump on November 6, the Shenzhen Component GEM Index has entered a period of horizontal shock and adjustment. So after today&#39;s close, the sideways shock has reached the 12th day, and tomorrow will be the critical 13th day. I think the market may have a big positive line tomorrow that will change the market. 4. Stock market general: It will be bearish tomorrow. A-shares saw a sharp adjustment today, and the BSE 50 bucked the trend and rose. The main funds have been frantically smashing the market and shipping for two consecutive days, making retail investors sad. In this market situation, I remind everyone to practice martial arts well in order to outperform the main force, and pay attention to the bargain hunting opportunities after the adjustment is completed. After the short-term shock adjustment, there will be a new round of rebound. 5. Mengruo Shenji: The short-term market is erratic and the main line of market logic is unclear. I will not write this stock review for the time being, but Shenji insists that the idea of bank stocks will not waver. In more than 100 days from August 1 to now, big money has not made a single move. This is extremely rare in the history of the stock market, and it rarely occurs even in major bear markets. 6. Finance Li Qiqi: The bearish market will rise many times tomorrow, but the trading volume does not show a good increase. Since it can&#39;t go up, then go back to the accumulating market, so the market will adjust in the short term. For those who cashed in yesterday&#39;s high, patiently wait for the pullback. There is still room to step back below the 30-60 minute top divergence. The bottom is expected to bottom out near 3010~3030. After adjustment, it will break through! Wait for the market to come back in place. 7. Guo Xiaofan Finance: My personal view is that I will be bullish tomorrow. The option delivery day is also over. There will be no reason to short in the next two days. Today, the market has been smashed again, and there is a high probability that it will rise. In particular, new energy will rebound, but the main board is still hopeless. No one is interested in positions such as finance and liquor. 8. Brother Cai’s market outlook: Tomorrow the bearish market found the support of the lower moving average last Friday. It climbed to the upper track on Monday and the pressure stopped. Yesterday, the breakthrough of the upper pressure failed. Since today’s correction has not been adjusted in place, there is a high probability that it will continue tomorrow. It is necessary to explore the bottom, and it is very likely to be a bottom-out and rebound. Everyone should pay attention to seizing the new round of low-level layout opportunities. 9. Running stocks: Bullish tomorrow. The market will have a slight upward trend tomorrow. This increase is actually negligible, and it is a closing form similar to a cross star. To be honest, whether Thursday is black or not, it doesn’t mean anything anymore. 10. Zetianshi: The reasonable bullish adjustment time and space tomorrow is &#39;Thursday, 3044&#39;. Today, Wednesday, the closing price is 3043. From this perspective, the &quot;minimum adjustment space target&quot; has been completed and slightly ahead of schedule. Of course, In addition to 3044, there are still reasonable retracement levels such as 3035, 3028, and 3019. I believe that the ideal trend tomorrow will either open flat and rise, or fall back to one of the above reasonable retracement levels and &quot;golden needle to find the bottom.&quot; 11. Professor Convex Returns: Tomorrow A one-day bullish callback cannot explain anything. In today&#39;s case, the subsequent rise of the market will only be easier, because the bearish people have left the market. I say that today&#39;s callback is a washout, and the trend of the market is to fluctuate upward. Big technology led by AI artificial intelligence will hit new historical highs in the future.

296,"Follow-up comments from Guangdian Express (002152): The construction of &quot;Digital Bay Area&quot; is about to lay the foundation for the computing power platform. On November 21, 2023, Guangdong Province issued the &quot;Three-Year Action Plan for the Construction of &quot;Digital Bay Area&quot;&quot;, proposing to build a unified market for data elements , promote the establishment of unified data asset registration rules in the Greater Bay Area, explore authorized operations of public data, and support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges in establishing national-level data exchanges. With the gradual implementation of early concept applications such as data assets and data transactions, the market surrounding digital infrastructure is expected to stimulate a new round of investment opportunities. As one of the core participants in Guangzhou&#39;s digital infrastructure, SVA Express has a layout in data, computing power, algorithms, scenarios, etc. It is expected to gain market opportunities by virtue of its first-mover advantage in this field and ecological construction. It is recommended to pay attention to the progress of data transactions and the company&#39;s continued development in this field. Guangdong Province issued the &quot;Three-Year Action Plan for the Construction of the &quot;Digital Bay Area&quot;&quot; to support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges in establishing national data exchanges. The &quot;Plan&quot; proposes to build a unified market for data elements, promote the establishment of unified data asset registration rules in the Greater Bay Area, explore authorized operations of public data, and realize the integrated application of public data and social data. The &quot;Plan&quot; proposes to support commercial banks that meet relevant qualifications to carry out internal data cross-border flow pilots, and rely on platforms such as the National Supercomputing Guangzhou Center to help enterprises and scientific research institutions in the Greater Bay Area improve the use of computing power and the iteration efficiency of original algorithms. The &quot;Plan&quot; supports the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges to establish national data exchanges and build a Greater Bay Area data element trading market with unified market systems, trading rules and platform carriers. We believe that the &quot;Plan&quot; has set clear goals and development rhythms, and the relevant layout is expected to drive the flow of regional data elements first and gradually move towards the national level. According to the announcement of Guangdian Express, the company holds 10.5% equity in Guangzhou Data Exchange and is expected to benefit from the development of the data trading market in the future. China Radio and Television Express actively deploys the data element market and empowers it in many aspects such as &quot;data, computing power, algorithms, and scenarios&quot;.

297,"[Large Cap or Small Cap] ➤ Small and medium-cap investments have been very popular recently. First, the micro-cap index became popular. According to statistics, it has increased by more than 40% this year. Immediately afterwards, the North Securities Index also became popular. Observing the market in the past two days, the increase of the North Securities 50 can be described as &quot;far ahead&quot;. This also puts the market into a game of whether to &quot;buy big&quot; or &quot;buy small.&quot; Looking back from 2019 to 2021, large-cap value investment has always occupied the high ground, and the leader is king. Now, the tide seems to have changed. Since the beginning of this year, observing different market capitalization style indexes, the market index has adjusted more, with a decrease of -9.12%. The declines in the mid-cap and small-cap indexes gradually converged to -8.81% and -1.27%, and the micro-cap index even achieved an increase of +44.4%. ➤Looking back at history, the rotation between small caps and large caps has also gone through several cycles. Combined with the historical background behind each cycle, it is not difficult to find that industrial rotation is the main driving factor behind it. For example, the consumer electronics industry from 2007 to 2010, the Internet+ industry from 2013 to 2015, new energy and artificial intelligence in the past two years, etc. The small and mid-cap style often corresponds to the rise of emerging industries, while the large-cap style is often supported by the recovery of traditional industries. ➤What is the logic behind the outperformance of small caps this year? For small caps to outperform the broader caps, three supporting factors are often needed: first, loose liquidity, second, the upward cycle of the industry, and third, support from national policies. In the context of economic pressure and loose liquidity, funds tend to gather in high-prosperity tracks and high-growth companies. At this time, if these emerging industries are in an upward cycle and are supported by many policy conditions, the strength of small and mid-cap stocks may last longer. ➤Does the market have such conditions this year? First, the liquidity level: The economy continues to be weakly recovering this year, and market liquidity is relatively abundant. For example, the recent announcement by the index company that the North Exchange stock will be included in the CSI All Index sample space will also greatly increase the liquidity of the North Exchange stock, thereby promoting the recent market trend of the North Exchange. Secondly, at the industrial level, many fields such as AI, smart cars, and semiconductors have made great progress in recent years. However, the market value of these companies is relatively small, and the market is expected to have relatively large potential. Finally, at the policy level, the state has always actively supported the cultivation of specialized, new, small and micro enterprises, and has introduced policies such as &quot;High-Quality Construction of the Beijing Stock Exchange&quot; to fully support small and micro enterprises in financing and becoming bigger and stronger. Therefore, the continued strength of small and medium-sized caps in this round is not accidental, and is supported by strong logic. But when we pay attention to the market situation, the risks cannot be ignored. ➤Can I still buy the small and medium-sized caps currently? From a valuation perspective, after the early market conditions, the price-to-earnings ratio quantiles of small and medium-cap stocks represented by indices such as CSI 1000 and CSI 2000 have indeed risen to historically high levels. The price-to-earnings ratio of the CSI 1000 Index has exceeded the 47% mark in the past decade, while the price-to-earnings ratio of the China Securities 2000 Index has also exceeded the 60% mark in the past decade. However, compared to these two types of indexes, what the director would like to remind you is the most popular micro-cap index in recent times. The extreme market conditions do not mean that it is suitable for everyone to invest. Judging from the compilation rules of this index, it selects the 400 stocks with the smallest market capitalization, and dynamically adjusts and balances positions every day, maintaining equal weight holdings. This means that it is constantly buying low and selling high, but No rebalancing costs are considered. However, from a practical perspective, the cost of position adjustment for such micro-cap stocks is still very high, and the investment risk will be greater. Towards the end of the year, the market is gradually beginning to anticipate a style switch. After the small and mid-cap market has fermented for a certain period of time, it is worth paying attention to whether it will usher in a rotation. Especially for ordinary investors, small and mid-cap investments are indeed highly elastic, but they are also subject to high volatility. Whether you are suitable for this type of investment depends on your own risk tolerance and your ability. If you are optimistic about this type of style, it is also recommended that you use common broad-based indexes instead of tracking unpopular indexes to layout.

Shenzhen state-owned concept stocks opened strongly, with Shenzhen City Communications, Shenzhen Zhenye A, Eternal Asia, etc. reaching their daily limit. Retail concept stocks performed actively, with Xujiahui having 2 consecutive boards. On the downside, computing power leasing concept stocks fell into adjustment, and Litong Electronics fell by the limit. Generally speaking, individual stocks fell more than they rose, with nearly 4,000 stocks in the market falling. The turnover of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets today was 875.5 billion, a decrease of 122.6 billion from the previous trading day. In terms of sectors, the short drama media sector once again ranked among the top gainers. Haikan shares hit the daily limit of 20CM, Gravity Media had 5 consecutive boards, Chinese Online rose by more than 15%, and Tianwei Video, Huanrui Century, Gravity Media, and Simei Media hit the daily limit. On the news, according to an announcement from the State Administration of Radio and Television, the number of online micro-short dramas approved for distribution has increased from 116 in the second quarter of 2023 to 150 in the third quarter of 2023, and the supply quantity has increased significantly. At the same time, the audience for short plays is gradually expanding. According to the &quot;2023 China Online Audiovisual Development Research Report&quot;, among the 1 billion short video users in 2022, about 50.4% of users have watched micro short plays within 3 minutes. Huachuang Securities Research Report believes that short dramas are a fast business with the characteristics of low threshold, low investment and quick return on costs. The scripts are mostly online texts + the actors are mainly Internet celebrities and small stars. Compared with professional dramas, the investment in a single film is very low (Generally speaking, the cost of an ordinary short drama is about 10-50W, and the shooting time is 1-2 weeks). The entry threshold is not high. From the perspective of the industry chain, the upstream of the short drama industry is the IP or copyright of short dramas provided by companies such as online literature, animation, and games; the midstream is content production, with MCNs, film and television companies or creative experts cooperating to shoot and produce; the downstream is content distribution. In the context of collective adjustments in the pan-tech direction, short drama media has become the only remaining direction that can break out of the continuity of the sector. Under the effect of capital grouping, there may still be room for further upward movement in the future. However, after today&#39;s collective outbreak of the sector, short-term sentiment may reach a climax, and it is expected that the differentiation of individual stocks within the sector may intensify in the future. Under the current market style, the focus should still be more focused on paying attention to the front row core. Shenzhen state-owned concept stocks opened strongly, with Shenzhen City Communications, Shenzhen Zhenye A, Eternal Asia, Shenzhen Water Resources Planning Institute, etc. reaching their daily limit. On the news, according to Jiemian News, Wu Hui, the former chairman of Shenzhen Water Affairs (Group) Co., Ltd., joined Honor Terminal Co., Ltd. last month. One of Wu Hui’s main tasks at Honor is to promote the company’s listing process. This may mean that Honor is one step closer to being listed. It is worth noting that Honor has repeatedly reported plans to go public via backdoor listing. Although Honor denied it in December last year, a number of rumored backdoor targets, such as Shenzhen Communications, Bird Holdings, Tianyin Holdings, etc., all experienced a &quot;roller coaster&quot; in stock prices. Therefore, in the current context of strong speculative sentiment, the above news has once again awakened the memory of speculation about the concept of Shenzhen&#39;s state-owned assets. As for the continuity, further observation remains. In addition, the Beixin 50 Index rose again by more than 8%, 15 Beixin stocks hit their daily limit, more than 100 stocks rose by more than 10%, and the Beixin&#39;s trading volume reached 13.1 billion yuan throughout the day, setting a new record again. In terms of news, it is reported that investors on the Beijing Stock Exchange have been &quot;running to enter the market&quot; in recent days. As of today, the number of qualified investors on the Beijing Stock Exchange has reached 6.26 million, an increase of nearly 700,000 since the launch of Article 19 of the deep reform on September 1. As for the current round of speculation on the Beijing Stock Exchange, it continues yesterday’s view. In the short term, it is still expected to be active again under the emotional game of funds. Such extreme surges in the recent past are unlikely to become the norm. Under the background that the overall liquidity is far inferior to that of the main board, once the subsequent speculation If the sentiment falls, there may be an overall risk of ebbing. ￼In terms of individual stocks, the short-term speculative atmosphere continues to be active today, and both the number of daily limits and the promotion rate of listed stocks in the two cities have remained at a high level. Among them, Sanbaishuo, the high-standard leader, once again performed on the floor today and successfully expanded the market height to 9 boards. Under the fund imitation effect, stocks with numbers in their names have also strengthened one after another (such as Sanxiang Impression, Yibin Technology, Sanxiang New Materials, Jiuding Investment, etc.). In fact, whether it is the previous &quot;dragon generation&quot;, or the recent &quot;containing numbers&quot; concept, or the speculation of individual stocks on the Beijing Stock Exchange. These directions have no obvious industrial logic and are essentially manifestations of a purely emotional game. On the one hand, funds are actively looking for New Year’s Eve monster stocks, and on the other hand, they are also catching up with the adjustment node of the pan-tech direction. Therefore, before the short-term sentiment fully ebbs, similar purely speculative speculation may become the main short-term style in the current market. It will be repeated in subsequent games. ￼ Market outlook analysis As of the close, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index fell 0.79%, the Shenzhen Component Index fell 1.41%, and the ChiNext Index fell 1.73%. Northbound funds sold a net 3.539 billion yuan throughout the day, of which 701 million yuan was sold on the Shanghai Stock Connect and 2.838 billion yuan was sold on the Shenzhen Stock Connect. At present, the overall market differentiation is intensifying. On the one hand, the index side continues to fall. Among them, the ChiNext Index fell relatively weakly. While the 30-day moving average effectively fell below it again, it returned to the structure of oscillating lower around the 5-day moving average. The short-term continuation of the second The probability of stepping back is still not low. On the other hand, the short-term speculative atmosphere continues to be active. The daily daily limit and the number of listed stocks remain high. In the absence of a main line in the market, the group style of listed stocks has gained popularity among funds. Although it is unlikely that all the stocks will recede at once in the context of such a large number of conglomerates, as the speculative group market continues to play out, internal differences may gradually intensify, and it is expected that high-level conglomerates will enter a brutal knockout round. model, when the individual stocks you hold show obvious signs of weakening or ebbing doubts, it may be safer to be on the risk-averse side first. Today&#39;s short-term sentiment has formed a certain deviation from the index. Against the background of the three major indexes falling across the board, the sentiment indicator can still maintain a oscillating trend between the 0 axis and the downturn zone. ￼Market News Focus 1.

301,"Today&#39;s closing comment 20231122: Today the market opened lower and moved lower, with the GEM index leading the decline and the BSE 50 Index rising by more than 8% again. The turnover of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets today was 875.5 billion, a decrease of 122.6 billion from the previous trading day. Northbound funds sold exceeded 3 billion yuan. The Beijing Stock Exchange 50 Index, which has been rising sharply for many days, rose another 8.43% today. 15 North Exchange stocks reached their daily limit, and more than 100 stocks rose by more than 10%. The trading volume of the North Exchange reached 13.1 billion yuan throughout the day, setting a new record high. Although the size of the BSE 50 is not large enough to draw too much money from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, the shift in emotional hot spots makes today&#39;s market look a little cold. As for the current round of speculation on the Beijing Stock Exchange, yesterday’s view continues. In the short term, it is still expected to be active again under the emotional game of funds. However, such extreme surges in the recent past are unlikely to become the norm. Under the background that the overall liquidity is far inferior to that of the main board, once the follow-up The decline in speculation may face the risk of an overall ebb. Industry sectors rose less and fell more. The media, engineering consulting services, commercial department stores, automotive services, and software development sectors were the top gainers, while the energy metals, motors, complete automobiles, wind power equipment, and communication equipment sectors were the top losers. Among them, the media sector has recovered some of its losses since the decline in June after today&#39;s positive line. The influence of artificial intelligence has driven repeated fluctuations in the sector. In contrast, wind power equipment and even the entire new energy sector are still in the bottoming stage. Yesterday, the securities were able to make a push, which is an important basis for us to judge that the current market can still break through 3100 points. Today, it is completely difficult to be independent, so the funds did not break through 3100 points in one go, and the chips were a little loose. After the ebb of technology for two consecutive days, it continued The probability of facing a round of backlash has become higher (although the media still has an independent new high today, it is not worth pursuing). At present, the overall market differentiation is intensifying. On the one hand, the index side continues to fall. Among them, the ChiNext Index fell relatively weakly. While the 30-day moving average effectively fell below it again, it returned to the structure of oscillating lower around the 5-day moving average. The short-term continuation of the second The probability of stepping back is still not low. On the other hand, the short-term speculative atmosphere continues to be active. The daily daily limit and the number of listed stocks remain high. In the context of unclear market main lines, speculative speculation has become the main style of the short-term market. However, as market differences intensify , the listed stocks may enter the knockout mode in the future.

302,"Following the release of a new episode of the Aston Originals podcast, hosted by experts Dr Duane Mellor and Dr Srikanth Bellary, the university’s diabetes research and how the disease affects communities around Birmingham are discussed. The theme of World Diabetes Day 2023 is getting diabetes care and understanding the risks. Complications of diabetes include circulatory problems, kidney problems and eye damage, and getting the right information and care can significantly reduce your risk. Globally alone, one in 10 people has diabetes, more than 90% of which are type 2 diabetes, half of which are undiagnosed. With treatment and healthy lifestyle habits, people with type 2 diabetes can delay or prevent complications. Experts from Aston University, including Dr Duane Mellor from the School of Medicine and Dr Srikanth Bellary from the School of Biological Sciences, explored risk factors for type 2 diabetes, particularly the prevalence of obesity in deprived areas. People in poor areas often lack opportunities for physical activity and have limited access to healthy foods, which increases the risk of diabetes. Aston University strives to address these social inequalities through research. Although type 2 diabetes is usually associated with older people, an increasing number of younger people, especially those who are obese or from black and South Asian communities, are also being diagnosed with the disease. Dr Bellary is committed to raising awareness of diabetes among young people, particularly among Aston University’s diverse student body. Advances in blood glucose monitoring technology in recent years have made it easier for patients to manage their diabetes, but digital poverty and access remain issues of concern. Dr. Mellor and Dr. Bellary also believe that artificial intelligence (AI) may play a key role in improving diabetes care in the future.

305,"[Hard technology requires patient capital | Exclusive interview with Mi Lei, founding partner of Zhongke Chuangxing] In the era of mobile Internet, the Chinese market has achieved great success. The world’s attention is focused on this entrepreneurial land with unlimited potential. Venture capital has begun to become a One of the leading forces in the business world. However, far away from the eye of the mobile Internet storm, the Xi&#39;an Institute of Optics and Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an investment institution that proposes hard technology investment concepts was established in Xi&#39;an, focusing on investing and incubating innovative technologies that may change the direction of human civilization. In an investment era where model innovation is the mainstream, the concept of &quot;&quot;investment&quot; was put forward. Today, ten years later, China Science and Technology Star has invested in more than 420 hard technology companies. In this issue, Dr., the founding partner of Zhongke Chuangxing, was invited to talk about his observations and thoughts on hard technology investment in the past ten years. Zhang Lan: You are the proposer and advocate of the concept of hard technology. China Science and Technology Star has also gone through ten years on this road. From the initial proposal of hard technology to now, the waves of technology have risen one after another. Now regarding the eight fields of hard technology, do you think there will be more? Mi Lei: At present, this conclusion has not been particularly challenged, and it is still in the fields proposed at that time. But we use the ideas of physics to condense these eight fields into five major directions, namely matter, energy, information, space, and life. These five major directions constitute an underlying logic, and all other hard technology directions are actually differentiated from these five major directions. Zhang Lan: At the event at the beginning of this year, we mentioned three directions: artificial intelligence, unlimited energy and unlimited life. The five directions you mentioned should be more specific than this summary. So among these five directions, which ones do you focus on and are most optimistic about? Mi Lei: In the information field, we believe that information is from electricity to light, and from electrons to photons. Photon technology will become mainstream in the information field in the future. My point of view is: Just based on the infrastructure of artificial intelligence, the information industry will be an intelligent industry in the future. In the current era of artificial intelligence, photonic technology has become the core of artificial intelligence infrastructure. Recently, TSMC and NVIDIA have begun to use it on GPUs, which has also verified this view. As an important infrastructure for the next industrial revolution, computing power will develop into photon computing and quantum computing in the future, which are key technical fields in the future of the information industry. The energy field, especially the topic of carbon neutrality, has also received a lot of attention. In this regard, superconducting and controllable nuclear fusion technology are considered to be a complete subversion of the energy revolution. If realized, it will promote mankind to enter a Type I civilization and achieve free energy. , free Internet access, and the prospect of free electricity; in the space field, commercial aviation, commercial aerospace, as well as human exploration of Mars and the moon and the establishment of mobile stations are very exciting. Technologies such as electric aircraft and supersonic aircraft can also significantly change us humans. travel and life; in the field of materials, the emergence of new materials, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, new alloys and polymer materials, will replace traditional materials and promote the vigorous development of hard technology entrepreneurship.

Other directors include Summers, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, and current member Adam D&#39;Angelo, co-founder and CEO of Quora Inc. OpenAI released a statement on X (formerly Twitter), saying the company is &quot;discussing specific details.&quot; After Altman was unexpectedly removed, almost all OpenAI employees threatened to resign, and the company decided to reappoint its co-founder. The decision quickly prompted congratulations from key figures at X, including former president Greg Brockman, who said he would also be returning, as did chief technology officer Mira Murati. Altman was fired on Friday over disagreements with the board over the rapid development and commercialization of artificial intelligence. He has been negotiating with the company for reinstatement. Those talks stalled on Sunday as Altman and others pressured existing board members to resign, according to people familiar with the matter. Ultimately, the board appointed a new leader—former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear—and Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s biggest backer, said it would hire Altman to lead a new internal AI team. In just a few hours, the majority of OpenAI&#39;s 770 employees signed a letter to the board of directors saying they might leave to join Microsoft if they didn&#39;t all resign and reinstate Altman. Signatories to the letter include Murati, who was named interim CEO, and OpenAI co-founder and board member Ilya Sutskever, who has differences with Altman over the company&#39;s direction. Sutskever posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday: &quot;I deeply regret participating in the board&#39;s decision. I never meant to harm OpenAI. I love everything we have created together and will do my best to restore unity to the company.&quot; Altman The return caps a tumultuous past few days that have plunged the world&#39;s best-known AI startup into chaos. Summers is a Harvard professor and a staff writer for Bloomberg Television who also serves on the boards of Jack Dorsey&#39;s Block Inc. and Skillsoft Corp. This swift policy reversal may appease investors and reduce the risk of employee exodus en masse. However, it also raises questions about the future path for ChatGPT’s makers and other AI startups. These companies have struggled to find a balance between developing artificial intelligence responsibly while raising huge sums of money from investors to support the expensive computing infrastructure required to build these tools. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and aim to benefit mankind rather than pursue financial gain. The organization later transformed into a profit-cap company and raised billions of dollars from Microsoft and other investors. Although Altman played a major role in these transactions, OpenAI is still governed by a nonprofit board of directors. In recent days, this internal tension has intensified and become the focus of public attention. News of Altman&#39;s removal caught the startup&#39;s investors off guard. Microsoft, one of the major backers that invested more than $10 billion in the startup, was notified only minutes before Altman was fired. The software giant then began working with investors including Thrive Capital and Tiger Global Management to try to bring Altman back. People familiar with the matter said they wished to discuss the private information anonymously. But when that effort failed, Microsoft decided to hire Altman and others from OpenAI. Meanwhile, OpenAI faces a new uncertainty: whether to let employees sell their shares at a valuation of $86 billion. Thrive, which is expected to lead the employee stock tender offer, had not paid as of Saturday and told OpenAI that Altman&#39;s departure would affect its decision-making, people familiar with the matter said. Among all the figures, the 38-year-old Altman has become the spokesperson of artificial intelligence technology in the new era with the success and popularity of ChatGPT. This year, Altman has not only been actively working with regulators within the industry, but has also met regularly with world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. On Thursday, he also participated in an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation panel discussion with other executives and world leaders to discuss the future of AI and its risks. But behind the scenes, conflicts between Altman and board members escalated, particularly with Sutskever. They disagree on how to quickly develop generative AI, how to commercialize the product, and what measures to take to mitigate its potential harm to the public, according to people familiar with the matter. Other board members at the time included D&#39;Angelo, Tasha McCauley, CEO of GeoSimSystems, and Helen Toner, director of strategic and basic research grant programs at Georgetown University&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. Beyond strategic differences, board members also had to contend with Altman&#39;s entrepreneurial ambitions. Altman has been trying to raise billions of dollars from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East to start an AI chip company that would compete with Nvidia Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. In addition, Altman is also negotiating with SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman Masayoshi Son, hoping to obtain billions of dollars in investment to collaborate with former Apple designer Jony Ive to develop AI-oriented hardware. Altman&#39;s side hustles add complexity to his relationship with the board. OpenAI said in a statement on Friday that the board&#39;s internal review found that Altman was not always candid in his communications with the board, which hindered the board from fulfilling its responsibilities. As a result, the board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. The boardroom shakeup is reminiscent of other major events in Silicon Valley history. For example, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was fired in 1985 and returned more than a decade later; Twitter co-founder Dorsey left in 2008 and returned as CEO seven years later.

To solve the problems of the century and the times, we need to continue to build global development consensus, inspire global development confidence, gather global development forces, and work together. Create development results. Entering the new era, China has adhered to the priority of development, made every effort to promote global development cooperation, deeply participated in global development governance, and made remarkable achievements. Former Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said that the implementation of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative has enhanced the connectivity of the co-building countries in the fields of economy, culture, education and other fields, promoted people-to-people connectivity, and promoted win-win cooperation. Adrian Nastase, former Prime Minister of Romania, pointed out that China has always insisted on seeking common ground while reserving differences in global development concepts, rules, and standards. It strives to promote North-South cooperation, is committed to answering common questions, and provides action plans for the common development of all parties. Former British Business Secretary Vince Cable believes that as the &quot;three major global initiatives&quot; continue to be implemented and continue to promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind, China has the opportunity and ability to engage in dialogue and cooperation with other countries to jointly address climate change, Global challenges such as human health and uneven economic development between the North and the South should be actively played in adhering to multilateralism, strengthening mutual learning among civilizations, and promoting changes in the global governance system. Luo Zhaohui, Director of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, said that currently, around global development, the game between great powers is intensifying, North-South cooperation is slowing down, and the development gap is widening. We should strengthen the leading role of the United Nations, promote deepening cooperation among countries, and promote the common development of the &quot;Global South&quot; Demonstrate greater responsibility and greater achievements in coordinating security and development, unite and work together, and make new contributions to the implementation of the &quot;three major global initiatives&quot; and the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative, continue to promote global common development, and realize the vision of world modernization . Various problems and challenges existing in today&#39;s world need to be solved by relying on development, changes in development models and further development. The theme report released by the forum, &quot;Development as the Solution and Globalization as the Development Platform,&quot; proposed that the development path leading to 2050 should adhere to development priority, adhere to the people-centered approach, adhere to fairness, universal benefit, inclusiveness, and adhere to innovation Driven by adhering to the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, and adhering to action orientation. China and the world&#39;s intellectual community are jointly faced with the important task of creating and developing new, more sound and effective development theories. They should focus on development and make development the central issue of knowledge production; use Chinese-style modernization as an example to build practical and effective development theories. Theory; transcend national and national standards and build a theory of global common development. Zhang Donggang, Secretary of the Party Committee of Renmin University of China, announced seven action initiatives proposed by the &quot;Tongzhou Global Development Forum&quot; mechanism at the meeting. First, focus on expanding global development cooperation, adhering to the principle of openness, building a global academic cooperation network, building a high-end strategic dialogue and cooperation platform, and promoting the construction of a new era that takes development as the solution, the world as the development platform, and peace and development as the goals. pattern. The second is to work together to promote global development as a priority, unite the global intellectual community, create more public intellectual products and smart products that promote the progress of human civilization, produce more new knowledge achievements that serve economic and scientific and technological progress, and help achieve a people-centered and universal benefit. A healthy new development that is inclusive, innovation-driven, and harmonious between man and nature. The third is to focus on solving global security problems, promote knowledge innovation, theoretical innovation, and method innovation, actively respond to global issues such as network security, biosecurity, data security, and artificial intelligence security, and prevent and resolve security risks. The fourth is to focus on optimizing global security governance, actively participate in research on major global issues, practice and promote the common values of all mankind, and promote global governance in a more fair and reasonable direction. The fifth is to work together to enhance exchanges among global civilizations, strengthen international academic exchanges and cooperation, and promote mutual learning and exchange among different civilizations in the world. Sixth, we must work together to promote the progress of global civilization, promote the creative transformation and innovative development of excellent traditional cultures of various countries, and jointly promote new progress in the development of human civilization. Seventh, establish a permanent mechanism for the forum to promote the implementation of relevant action initiatives.

314,"[Artificial Intelligence Safety: The story behind the shock to OpenAI’s management? 】The development of artificial intelligence has brought great convenience and well-being to mankind, but it has also brought some risks and challenges, such as data privacy, algorithm bias, human-machine conflict, super intelligence, etc. How to ensure the safety of artificial intelligence is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Recently, OpenAI, a leading company in the field of artificial intelligence, experienced a management shock that shocked the technology industry. OpenAI&#39;s board of directors announced on Friday that CEO Sam Altman was fired and left the board because he was &quot;not candid&quot; in his communications with the board, which affected the board&#39;s ability to perform its duties. Altman&#39;s firing sent shockwaves through the tech world, sparking various rumors on social media about the reasons behind Altman&#39;s departure, which have not yet been confirmed. A key factor in Altman&#39;s firing was reportedly the tension between him and the OpenAI board of directors, with Altman favoring a more aggressive push for AI development and the board wanting to move more cautiously. Members of OpenAI&#39;s board of directors have different concepts and views on the safety of artificial intelligence, which may be the root cause of the management shock. Altman and Brockman believe that the development of artificial intelligence should be more open and rapid to benefit more people, but also to prevent other organizations from gaining the advantages of artificial intelligence. They advocate more investment in commercializing and scaling AI, as well as more collaboration with other companies and institutions. They also support increased development and use of ChatGPT. Other members of the board of directors, Sutskever and Toner, believe that the development of artificial intelligence should be more cautious and responsible to avoid possible harm and unpredictable consequences. They advocate paying more attention to the safety and ethics of artificial intelligence, as well as more communication and coordination with governments and society, such as the United Nations, the European Union, the U.S. Congress, etc. They also oppose excessive reliance and use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence tool that may have powerful influence and potential risks. It may be used to create false and misleading information, such as fake news, rumors, slander, etc. The conflict between these two concepts caused a huge shock to OpenAI&#39;s management and also reflected a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence: how to balance the development and safety of artificial intelligence. There is no easy answer to this question, and it requires joint efforts and collaboration from all parties to ensure that artificial intelligence can bring more benefits to mankind rather than harm. Artificial intelligence close d",201,-0.07409862896658737,8,7,193,20,2,0,0,3,13,0,100.0,"[0.5458502327007766, 0.9985978643965766, 0.8985858472499898, 0.9555770068163357, 0.020423567591211667, 0.47851642166692154, 0.7272727272727275, 0.9049039727660679, 0.32719906417647937, 0.38999085341709927, 0.8461236916298395, 0.5763659455098461, 0.639487745871165, 0.9730327356124759, 0.8333333333333333, 0.7499999999999999, 0.8802160446689558, 0.9698333141942553, 0.5483063146223912, 0.9312070129455884, 0.1879977881700916, 0.4737672181921908, 0.9587247148764262, 0.88415606527782, 0.746401771164652, 0.9595868871700222, 0.2170159283961085, 0.5987394914375233, 0.8537547346761496, 0.7413880459557418, 0.9802510645713247, 0.961974425924456, 0.7101116218262811, 0.5, 0.5, 0.7599368113517436, 0.7568535827627277, 0.9994689742408955, 0.3013495003702036, 0.7675012783855613, 0.851941551550238, 0.5999999999999999, 0.8459163975952467, 0.2282973417469133, 0.9981217454443116, 0.8137457507996273, 0.8638224267975559, 0.662282199590812, 0.725035859207249, 0.4408313612172662]"
315,"[] After a period of negotiations, late at night on November 21, local time, the artificial intelligence development organization OpenAI announced that it had reached an agreement in principle, and founder Sam Altman returned to the company as CEO, &quot;and formed a company led by Bret Taylor ( Chairman), Larry Summers, and Adam D&#39;Angelo. We are working together to figure out the details. Thank you very much for your patience on this.&quot; Just over 4 days have passed since the OpenAI board announced the removal of Altman, and this &quot; The drama &quot;Palace Fight&quot; has experienced reversals again and again, and the process is ups and downs and exciting. OpenAI high-level shock event timeline (San Francisco local time) Main figures: OpenAI co-founder and former CEO Sam Altman OpenAI co-founder and former president Greg Brockman OpenAI co-founder , Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella OpenAI Interim CEO Emmett · Emmett Shear Sutskvi notified Altman of a meeting on November 16. Altman attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit event in California and discussed art and artists at an event in Oakland. future. According to Brockman&#39;s post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Sutskwe texted Altman that night to ask about arranging a conference call at noon the next day. Brockman said Mulati learned that night that Altman would be fired. At noon on November 17, when Altman was publicly announced to be fired, Altman was in Las Vegas to attend the weekend&#39;s biggest party, the Formula One race. After clicking on the Google Meet link in the hotel room, Suzkowe said that he Will be fired, news will be announced soon. No explanation was given. Brockman said that shortly after noon on the 17th, he received a text message from Sutskwei requesting a call. After receiving the GoogleMeet link four minutes later, Brockman was informed that he would be removed as chairman of the board &quot;but will remain critical to the company and will retain his position as president&quot; and that Altman had been fired. At about the same time, OpenAI published an article on its blog announcing executive changes - Altman was publicly announced as being fired for &quot;consistently being uncandid in his communications with the board of directors and hindering the board of directors from fulfilling its responsibilities.&quot; ability&quot;. Mulati was appointed interim CEO. OpenAI held a general meeting that afternoon, at which Sutskwe defended the board&#39;s decision to oust Altman. He dismissed suggestions that ousting Ultraman amounted to a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; and claimed it was necessary to protect OpenAI&#39;s mission of &quot;making artificial intelligence benefit humanity.&quot; After the meeting, the executive team reconvened in the conference room. An executive told Sutskvi that the lack of detail in the termination announcement was unacceptable and asked other board members to participate in a video call to explain, according to people familiar with the matter. During the call, the executive team pressed the board for about 40 minutes to provide specific examples of Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonor,&quot; which the board refused to do, citing legal reasons. Some executives said they received inquiries from regulators and law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office in Manhattan about Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonesty.&quot; The board agreed to discuss the matter with its attorneys. They came back hours later but still wouldn&#39;t provide specifics. They say Ultraman is not honest and often does whatever he wants. The board said Altman was too well-versed for the board to give specific examples, according to people familiar with the executive. Executives requested written examples of board allegations. Microsoft issued a statement Microsoft&#39;s Nadella, a major OpenAI investor and partner, issued a statement: &quot;As you will see this week at Microsoft Ignite conference, we will continue to innovate rapidly for this era of AI. We are working across the entire technology stack More than 100 announcements have been made in , including AI systems, models and tools in Azure (Microsoft cloud) and Copilot. Most importantly, we are committed to providing our customers with all of this while building the future. We have signed a contract with OpenAI The long-term agreement provides full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and exciting product roadmap, and will continue to be committed to our partnerships, including Mira and the team. Together, we will continue to bring this The value of this technology brings to the whole world.&quot; Altman called Nadella and expressed his hope to continue studying this technology. They devised various ways to undo the day&#39;s events, but also began working on a backup plan for Altman to have a group of his top researchers create a new division within the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Brockman Resigns After reading the latest news, Brockman announced his resignation from OpenAI. After he sent a memo internally, he also published the text simultaneously on X. Altman told friends he was considering starting a new company with Brockman and poaching dozens of OpenAI employees. Senior OpenAI researcher resigns Following Brockman, three senior OpenAI researchers resigned, including research director Jakub Pachocki and the Get Ready team, which prepares to deal with the &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; of artificial intelligence. ) head Aleksander Madry. On November 18th, Ultraman was at home. Ultraman flew back to San Francisco immediately after being fired. His home became a war room filled with OpenAI employees, including then-interim CEO Murati and other members of the executive team, plotting his return to the company. Management and board of directors continue to negotiate OpenAI&#39;s internal memo comes to light, saying Altman was fired not because of &quot;malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, security or security/privacy practices,&quot; but because &quot;Sam &quot;There was a breakdown in communication between Altman and the board of directors.&quot; In the memo, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday&#39;s announcement &quot;came as a surprise to (the management team)&quot; and that management &quot;had multiple conversations with the board to try to better understand them.&quot; the reasons and processes behind decisions”. According to the memo, as of the morning of the 18th, discussions were still ongoing. OpenAI&#39;s financing at risk OpenAI&#39;s plan to sell employee shares, which would value the startup at about $86 billion, could be in jeopardy. Three sources at the company revealed that OpenAI no longer expects the deal, led by Thrive Capital, to happen or, if it does, the deal&#39;s valuation will be reduced due to recent developments. Ultraman Pitches New Business Ultraman pitches to investors that he plans to launch a new venture (perhaps an artificial intelligence chip startup), and Brockman is expected to join. Investors Push for Altman&#39;s Return Investors, including Microsoft, were outraged by the turn of events and pressured OpenAI&#39;s board of directors to reinstate Altman. Meanwhile, some of OpenAI&#39;s major venture backers are reportedly considering filing a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder and former OpenAI board member Reid Hoffman, have received advance notice Notice of decision to fire Ultraman. Board agreed in principle to change direction A source close to Altman said the board agreed in principle to resign and allow Altman and Brockman to return, but has since hesitated. On November 19, Ultraman returned to OpenAI headquarters for negotiations as a visitor. Mulati sent a note to employees, saying that Ultraman would return to the office. When Altman arrived, he used a visitor&#39;s pass to enter OpenAI&#39;s San Francisco headquarters to meet with the board of directors, and Brockman was invited to join. Altman, Brockman, Mulaty, Lightcap, head of strategy Jason Kwon and other members of the leadership team spent the day with the board as board negotiations hit a snag Negotiated, advocated for Altman&#39;s reinstatement and made recommendations for new board members. But predictably, directors are resisting. The board has not resigned, saying it is concerned about who could replace them and is reviewing candidates. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor may be a candidate. Another possible candidate is a Microsoft executive. Negotiations continued late into the night, with multiple rounds of takeout delivered to the office and reporters from multiple news outlets monitoring the scene like a papal conclave. Inside, employees gathered, some crying. Interim CEO replacement Ultimately, Sutskwe told employees that Altman would no longer serve as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI appointed Sher, co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO to replace Mulati. Meanwhile, the search for a new permanent CEO continues. According to a person familiar with the situation, the office software Slack sent a message to employees announcing an all-hands meeting with Scheer, but several employees responded with a middle finger emoji. Less than a dozen people were present. About 200 people waiting for a solution poured out of the building. In the lobby, Brockman&#39;s wife, Anna Brockman, cried and begged for reconsideration. In 2019, Sutskwe officiated at Brockman’s civil ceremony at the OpenAI offices. Altman joins Microsoft Nadella posted on X at midnight, announcing that Altman, Brockman and their colleagues would join a new artificial intelligence research team led by Microsoft. Ultraman retweeted this post to confirm. Nadella also opened the door to other OpenAI employees, saying they would receive the resources they need if they choose to join. OpenAI&#39;s board of directors reiterated its decision to issue an internal memo to company employees upholding its decision to remove Altman. &quot;Simply put, Sam&#39;s conduct and lack of transparency in his interactions with the board undermined the board&#39;s ability to effectively oversee the company in the manner authorized to do so.&quot; &quot;It is critical that any CEO be honest and transparent with the board .&quot; Refuting theories circulating on social media, the memo added, &quot;This decision has nothing to do with product safety, development speed, or OpenAI&#39;s finances.&quot; Employees have threatened to resign, and nearly 500 of OpenAI&#39;s roughly 770 employees, including Sutzke Wei) signed a joint letter stating that they may resign unless the board resigns and reappoints Altman. By the end of the day, the number of employees who had signed the letter climbed to 747. Altman forwarded a large number of posts from OpenAI employees on X saying &quot;OpenAI is nothing without employees.&quot; Altman then posted two more posts to appease OpenAI employees, saying he was proud of the company&#39;s management team and &quot;I&#39;m excited that we will all be working together in some way.&quot; Sutskvi expressed regret Sutskvi published a post on We will make every effort to reunite the company.&quot; Ultraman retweeted the post and added three red heart emoticons. On November 20, Ultraman and Brockman considered returning to Microsoft. The deal for Ultraman to switch to Microsoft has not yet been finalized. Ultraman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. The condition is that the other board members who initially fired Altman resign. Ultraman posted on X that &quot;we will all work together in some way,&quot; meaning the fight continues. That night, when Nadella was asked on a TV show whether Altman would become a Microsoft employee and whether 700 OpenAI employees would join Microsoft, he only said that &quot;this is a choice made by the OpenAI board of directors, management and employees.&quot; He said OpenAI needs a new governance structure. Microsoft has opened up a floor of space at its LinkedIn offices in San Francisco, outfitted with clusters of laptops and GPU chips to provide computing power for artificial intelligence, to accommodate its team in the event that getting Ultraman back to OpenAI fails. But a person familiar with Nadella&#39;s thinking said Microsoft&#39;s first goal is to return Altman as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI board considers merger with Anthropic People familiar with the matter said that OpenAI’s board of directors approached Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, a large language model developer, to discuss the possibility of combining the two companies. But Amodei quickly rejected the offer. On November 21, discussions were ongoing between Altman, Schell and at least one board member, Adam D&#39;Angelo, people familiar with the matter said. The talks also involved some of OpenAI’s investors. The company is trying to resolve the confusion surrounding company leadership before Thanksgiving (Nov. 23), hoping employees will not feel uncertain about their work status during the holiday, one person said. Conflict between Altman and board members exposed Sources familiar with the matter revealed that Altman had previously clashed with board member Helen Toner. She published an academic paper in October promoting the security practices of OpenAI competitor Anthropic, and Altman confronted her, saying she was harming the company. , Ultraman Returns OpenAI announced on social media that it has reached an agreement in principle, Ultraman will return to the company as CEO, &quot;and form a new board of directors composed of Chairman Bret Taylor, Larry Summers and Adam D&#39;Angelo. We are working together to find out Details.

316,"[Ultraman returns to OpenAI as CEO! 】After a period of negotiations, late at night on November 21, local time, the artificial intelligence development organization OpenAI announced that it had reached an agreement in principle, and founder Sam Altman returned to the company as CEO, &quot;and established a company led by Bret Taylor (Chairman) ), Larry Summers and Adam D&#39;Angelo. We are working together to figure out the details. Thank you very much for your patience on this.&quot; Just over 4 days have passed since the OpenAI board announced the removal of Altman. This &quot;Palace&quot; The drama of &quot;Fighting&quot; has experienced reversals again and again, and the process is ups and downs and exciting. OpenAI high-level shock event timeline (San Francisco local time) Main figures: OpenAI co-founder and former CEO Sam Altman OpenAI co-founder and former president Greg Brockman OpenAI co-founder , Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella OpenAI Interim CEO Emmett · Emmett Shear Sutskvi notified Altman of a meeting on November 16. Altman attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit event in California and discussed art and artists at an event in Oakland. future. According to Brockman&#39;s post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Sutskwe texted Altman that night to ask about arranging a conference call at noon the next day. Brockman said Mulati learned that night that Altman would be fired. At noon on November 17, when Altman was publicly announced to be fired, Altman was in Las Vegas to attend the weekend&#39;s biggest party, the Formula One race. After clicking on the Google Meet link in the hotel room, Suzkowe said that he Will be fired, news will be announced soon. No explanation was given. Brockman said that shortly after noon on the 17th, he received a text message from Sutskwei requesting a call. After receiving the GoogleMeet link four minutes later, Brockman was informed that he would be removed as chairman of the board &quot;but will remain critical to the company and will retain his position as president&quot; and that Altman had been fired. At about the same time, OpenAI published an article on its blog announcing executive changes - Altman was publicly announced as being fired for &quot;consistently being uncandid in his communications with the board of directors and hindering the board of directors from fulfilling its responsibilities.&quot; ability&quot;. Mulati was appointed interim CEO. OpenAI held a general meeting that afternoon, at which Sutskwe defended the board&#39;s decision to oust Altman. He dismissed suggestions that ousting Ultraman amounted to a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; and claimed it was necessary to protect OpenAI&#39;s mission of &quot;making artificial intelligence benefit humanity.&quot; After the meeting, the executive team reconvened in the conference room. An executive told Sutskvi that the lack of detail in the termination announcement was unacceptable and asked other board members to participate in a video call to explain, according to people familiar with the matter. During the call, the executive team pressed the board for about 40 minutes to provide specific examples of Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonor,&quot; which the board refused to do, citing legal reasons. Some executives said they received inquiries from regulators and law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office in Manhattan about Altman&#39;s &quot;dishonesty.&quot; The board agreed to discuss the matter with its attorneys. They came back hours later but still wouldn&#39;t provide specifics. They say Ultraman is not honest and often does whatever he wants. The board said Altman was too well-versed for the board to give specific examples, according to people familiar with the executive. Executives requested written examples of board allegations. Microsoft issued a statement Microsoft&#39;s Nadella, a major investor and partner in OpenAI, issued a statement: &quot;As you will see this week at Microsoft Ignite conference, we will continue to innovate rapidly for this era of AI. We are working across the entire technology stack More than 100 announcements have been made in , including AI systems, models and tools in Azure (Microsoft cloud) and Copilot. Most importantly, we are committed to providing our customers with all of this while building the future. We have signed a contract with OpenAI The long-term agreement provides full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and exciting product roadmap, and will continue to be committed to our partnerships, including Mira and the team. Together, we will continue to bring this The value of this technology brings to the whole world.&quot; Altman called Nadella and expressed his hope to continue studying this technology. They devised various ways to undo the day&#39;s events, but also began working on a backup plan for Altman to have a group of his top researchers create a new unit within the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Brockman Resigns After reading the latest news, Brockman announced his resignation from OpenAI. After he sent a memo internally, he also published the text simultaneously on X. Altman told friends he was considering starting a new company with Brockman and poaching dozens of OpenAI employees. Senior OpenAI researcher resigns Following Brockman, three senior OpenAI researchers resigned, including research director Jakub Pachocki and the Get Ready team, which prepares to deal with the &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; of artificial intelligence. ) head Aleksander Madry. On November 18th, Ultraman was at home. Ultraman flew back to San Francisco immediately after being fired. His home became a war room filled with OpenAI employees, including then-interim CEO Murati and other members of the executive team, plotting his return to the company. Management and board of directors continue to negotiate OpenAI&#39;s internal memo comes to light, saying Altman was fired not because of &quot;malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, security or security/privacy practices,&quot; but because &quot;Sam &quot;There was a breakdown in communication between Altman and the board of directors.&quot; In the memo, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday&#39;s announcement &quot;came as a surprise to (the management team)&quot; and that management &quot;had multiple conversations with the board to try to better understand them.&quot; the reasons and processes behind decisions”. According to the memo, as of the morning of the 18th, discussions were still ongoing. OpenAI&#39;s financing at risk OpenAI&#39;s plan to sell employee shares, which would value the startup at about $86 billion, could be in jeopardy. Three sources at the company revealed that OpenAI no longer expects the deal, led by Thrive Capital, to happen or, if it does, the deal&#39;s valuation will be reduced due to recent developments. Ultraman Pitches New Business Ultraman pitches to investors that he plans to launch a new venture (perhaps an artificial intelligence chip startup), and Brockman is expected to join. Investors Push for Altman&#39;s Return Investors, including Microsoft, were outraged by the turn of events and pressured OpenAI&#39;s board of directors to reinstate Altman. Meanwhile, some of OpenAI&#39;s major venture backers are reportedly considering filing a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder and former OpenAI board member Reid Hoffman, have received advance notice Notice of decision to fire Ultraman. Board agreed in principle to change direction A source close to Altman said the board agreed in principle to resign and allow Altman and Brockman to return, but has since hesitated. On November 19, Ultraman returned to OpenAI headquarters for negotiations as a visitor. Mulati sent a note to employees, saying that Ultraman would return to the office. When Altman arrived, he used a visitor&#39;s pass to enter OpenAI&#39;s San Francisco headquarters to meet with the board of directors, and Brockman was invited to join. Altman, Brockman, Mulaty, Lightcap, head of strategy Jason Kwon and other members of the leadership team spent the day with the board as board negotiations hit a snag Negotiated, advocated for Altman&#39;s reinstatement and made recommendations for new board members. But predictably, directors are resisting. The board has not resigned, saying it is concerned about who could replace them and is reviewing candidates. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor may be a candidate. Another possible candidate is a Microsoft executive. Negotiations continued late into the night, with multiple rounds of takeout delivered to the office and reporters from multiple news outlets monitoring the scene like a papal conclave. Inside, employees gathered, some crying. Interim CEO replacement Ultimately, Sutskwe told employees that Altman would no longer serve as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI appointed Sher, co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO to replace Mulati. Meanwhile, the search for a new permanent CEO continues. According to a person familiar with the situation, the office software Slack sent a message to employees announcing an all-hands meeting with Scheer, but several employees responded with a middle finger emoji. Less than a dozen people were present. About 200 people waiting for a solution poured out of the building. In the lobby, Brockman&#39;s wife, Anna Brockman, cried and begged for reconsideration. In 2019, Sutskwe officiated at Brockman’s civil ceremony at the OpenAI offices. Altman joins Microsoft Nadella posted on X at midnight, announcing that Altman, Brockman and their colleagues would join a new artificial intelligence research team led by Microsoft. Ultraman retweeted this post to confirm. Nadella also opened the door to other OpenAI employees, saying they would receive the resources they need if they choose to join. OpenAI&#39;s board of directors reiterated its decision to issue an internal memo to company employees upholding its decision to remove Altman. &quot;Simply put, Sam&#39;s conduct and lack of transparency in his interactions with the board undermined the board&#39;s ability to effectively oversee the company in the manner authorized to do so.&quot; &quot;It is critical that any CEO be honest and transparent with the board .&quot; Refuting theories circulating on social media, the memo added, &quot;This decision has nothing to do with product safety, development speed, or OpenAI&#39;s finances.&quot; Employees have threatened to resign, including nearly 500 of OpenAI&#39;s roughly 770 employees, including Sutzke Wei) signed a joint letter stating that they may resign unless the board resigns and reappoints Altman. By the end of the day, the number of employees who had signed the letter climbed to 747. Altman forwarded a large number of posts from OpenAI employees on X saying &quot;OpenAI is nothing without employees.&quot; Altman then posted two more posts to appease OpenAI employees, saying he was proud of the company&#39;s management team and &quot;I&#39;m excited that we will all be working together in some way.&quot; Sutskvi expressed regret Sutskvi published a post on We will make every effort to reunite the company.&quot; Ultraman retweeted the post and added three red heart emoticons. On November 20, Ultraman and Brockman considered returning to Microsoft. The deal for Ultraman to switch to Microsoft has not yet been finalized. Ultraman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. The condition is that the other board members who initially fired Altman resign. Ultraman posted on X that &quot;we will all work together in some way,&quot; meaning the fight continues. That night, when Nadella was asked on a TV show whether Altman would become a Microsoft employee and whether 700 OpenAI employees would join Microsoft, he only said that &quot;this is a choice made by the OpenAI board of directors, management and employees.&quot; He said OpenAI needs a new governance structure. Microsoft has opened up a floor of space at its LinkedIn offices in San Francisco, outfitted with clusters of laptops and GPU chips to provide computing power for artificial intelligence, to accommodate its team in the event that getting Ultraman back to OpenAI fails. But a person familiar with Nadella&#39;s thinking said Microsoft&#39;s first goal is to return Altman as OpenAI CEO. OpenAI board considers merger with Anthropic People familiar with the matter said that OpenAI’s board of directors has approached Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of large language model developer Anthropic, to discuss the possibility of combining the two companies. But Amodei quickly rejected the offer. On November 21, discussions were ongoing between Altman, Schell and at least one board member, Adam D&#39;Angelo, people familiar with the matter said. The talks also involved some of OpenAI’s investors. The company is working to resolve the confusion surrounding company leadership before Thanksgiving (Nov. 23), hoping employees will not feel uncertain about their work status during the holiday, one person said. Conflict between Altman and board members exposed Sources familiar with the matter revealed that Altman had previously clashed with board member Helen Toner.

317,"[Altman may still return to OpenAI] Now, almost all OpenAI employees have signed the joint letter calling on the board of directors to resign and reinstate Altman and others. As of press time, the OpenAI board of directors has not yet decided whether to leave on its own or watch its employees leave. And Altman has not decided to go to Microsoft, and plans to return to OpenAI. According to media reports, OpenAI Vice President of Global Affairs Anna Makanju told employees on November 20 (Monday) local time that OpenAI’s management team is negotiating with Altman and others, and OpenAI’s board of directors, but will not A consensus was quickly reached. Microsoft said that OpenAI &quot;must change&quot;, and CEO Nadella&#39;s attitude was &quot;at this point, I think it is very, very clear that some things must change around governance.&quot; The Information said that after the OpenAI board initially announced that Altman was ousted, other people were contacted to take over as OpenAI&#39;s CEO: - Nat Friedman (Nat Friedman), the former CEO of GitHub, engaged in venture capital after leaving GitHub, and invested in many Artificial Intelligence Company. -Alex Wang, co-founder and CEO of ScaleAI. ScaleAI is the largest data annotation startup in Silicon Valley and one of OpenAI&#39;s data annotation suppliers. -Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic. He previously worked at OpenAI and founded Anthropic after leaving in 2020. Anthropic is considered OpenAI’s biggest competitor. During this period, the OpenAI board of directors also discussed the merger of OpenAI and Anthropic with Amoudi. Finally, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear accepted the offer and became OpenAI’s interim CEO. -Amazon invested $4 billion in Anthropic. Google invested an additional $2 billion in October. -Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million in 2014. At a time of civil unrest at OpenAI, its customers are also looking for alternatives. According to reports, more than 100 OpenAI customers have contacted Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and other companies to inquire about business migration. They are worried that OpenAI&#39;s continued turmoil will affect the company&#39;s business operations. AWS and Anthropic temporarily formed a team to connect with OpenAI customers.

318,"Parkinson&#39;s disease is a chronic neurological disease first described by British physician James Parkinson in 1817. It usually develops in age 50 and later, and its incidence increases with age. The cause of Parkinson&#39;s disease is not fully understood, but may be related to factors such as environment, genetics and aging of the nervous system. The main symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease include resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscle stiffness, and postural balance disorders. Parkinson&#39;s disease affects patients&#39; health in many ways. First of all, from a psychological perspective, patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease often suffer from depression, anxiety and other psychological problems. This is mainly due to the physiological impact of the disease itself and the psychological pressure on patients when facing the disease. Secondly, in terms of movement, Parkinson&#39;s disease can cause muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, which in turn affects the patient&#39;s walking, coordination and balance abilities. In addition, sensory aspects can also be affected. For example, some people with Parkinson&#39;s disease may experience symptoms such as loss of smell and reduced pain perception. In terms of diet, patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease may have problems such as difficulty swallowing and oral muscle incoordination, which may lead to difficulty eating and choking. Finally, Parkinson&#39;s disease can also affect a patient&#39;s sleep. Many patients will suffer from insomnia, night awakenings and other problems, which will undoubtedly greatly reduce their quality of life. In addition, with the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, we may also see the emergence of more intelligent medical devices and treatments, which will bring more treatment options and hope to patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have their own advantages and disadvantages in the treatment of Parkinson&#39;s disease. The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine in treating Parkinson&#39;s disease include small side effects, good overall regulatory effect, and the ability to improve patients&#39; clinical symptoms and quality of life.

Market analysts have come to the conclusion that no matter how you calculate this outburst, it will be a short-term negative for Microsoft. Unexpectedly, last night, a move was made to completely reverse the situation and directly revitalize the situation. In this way, Microsoft is equivalent to investing in a cutting-edge AI team, and is also building a cutting-edge AI team. The deployment of the AI industry is full, the AI development trend is once again strengthened, and Microsoft&#39;s demand for computing power is even higher. building. Before the U.S. stock market opened, Microsoft once rose more than 2% and closed at around 2.05%.

321,"A-shares: The number one leader in “satellite navigation”, Huawei chip supplier, profits surged 428.17%. Read Lao Chen’s article and learn logical thinking! Many people in the market have this question: Why do companies with good performance not rise sharply, while companies with poor performance do so? If you are still stuck on this kind of question, it means you know too little about the market. If the stock price is determined by performance alone, then the market will be too simple, and performance only represents the temporary and does not represent the future. Although Lao Chen believes that the future must be about survival of the fittest, and good performance is the way to go, but this takes time. Why are you optimistic about satellite navigation? For the market, logic is very important. No matter what article you read, if you just want to pursue individual stocks, you will find that this is an endless road and the road is long. Only by mastering the underlying logic is the long-term method, and methods without Tao are just frivolous. First, strategic importance, wrong direction, and efforts in vain. Many people have gone in the wrong direction. Why is it not difficult to operate? For example: This year is the year of science and technology. If you go to play with ores, the result will be good. You didn’t choose the right direction. With the continuous development of communications, 6G is also receiving more and more attention. Countries want to build a global connection that integrates terrestrial communication networks, satellite communication networks and deep-sea ocean networks to realize the integration of air, space, sea and ground. Second, policies continue to be favorable and the market will be broad in the future. As my country attaches great importance to satellite navigation, policies are constantly being introduced to promote the development of its industry. Satellite navigation is also in its early stages of development. Because of its low cost, flexible launch, low energy consumption, and limited quantity, everyone wants to compete for a place, including autonomous driving, precise positioning, and the interconnection of all things. Satellite navigation will be needed in the future. Third, market selection. During the market adjustment period, satellite navigation continued to make breakthroughs, indicating that funds have already entered. Coupled with Huawei satellite phones, more mobile phones will be used in the future. Lao Chen also sorted out several companies in the satellite navigation sector, which can be collected and studied, especially the last leading satellite navigation company, Huawei chip supplier, which has a huge profit increase of 428.17% and has strong growth potential! Time will prove Nanzhu’s judgment, let’s take a look. 1. Hangyu Micro is one of the key companies in high-reliability embedded SOC chips and system integration in aerospace, and has perfected the core technology of satellite big data applications. Its second batch of satellites are being developed and debugged, and launch work is being steadily coordinated. 2. Higer Communications relies on its development advantages in the entire industry chain of &quot;antennas, modules, chips, systems, terminals, and operations&quot; to ensure the leading market position of Beidou institutions, break through the core technology of Beidou-3, master the technical system, and build chip competitiveness barrier. It is also an expert in the development of Beidou navigation equipment and a provider of electronic information system solutions for wireless communications covering the entire frequency band and laying out the entire industry chain. 3. Does Northern Navigation focus on &quot;navigation control and ammunition information technology&quot;, including radio and satellite communications, detection control, navigation control, electrical connectors and other technical aspects. 4. Huati Technology is committed to &quot;Nebula Zero Electricity&quot; and sky-wide wisdom, focusing on the four new infrastructure basic modules of &quot;cloud, star, electricity, and things&quot; (cloud services, satellite applications, new energy, and the Internet of Things) to build a &quot;sky, earth, and sky&quot; &quot;Integrated&quot; and &quot;Star-Cloud-Network-Terminal&quot; system service architecture. 5. The company that Lao Chen is most optimistic about has a huge profit increase of 428.17% and has strong growth potential! 1. Satellite navigation + 5G + 6G + storage chip + Huawei concept + artificial intelligence + data elements + driverless + chip. It has developed a number of core key technologies for remote sensing satellites and ground systems, and has also cooperated with Huawei. 2. The stock price is about 6 yuan, and the total market value is less than 3 billion. The bottom is large, and funds are in favor. Nearly 400 million have been raised at the bottom. 3. From a technical point of view, one positive crosses the long average, and the chips are concentrated, ushering in a strong golden cross on the monthly line, and a new round of main rising market is imminent.

322,"Good afternoon everyone! Today is Wednesday. It has been 13 trading days since the Shanghai Composite Index touched the 3060 line on November 6. During this period, the main institutions did nothing and only retreated to protect the market, and then hot money became the world. All kinds of chaos and chaotic stocks are flying all over the sky, including problem stocks, name stocks, and digital stocks, until they move to the Beijing Stock Exchange. Anyway, it’s a world dominated by hot money, and the rise makes no sense. But I believe that this phenomenon is an inevitable phenomenon in the early stages of building a big bottom. On the one hand, major institutions need to take advantage of the loss of values to attract goods and build positions. On the other hand, the main plot is to build a plank road in the open and covertly build the warehouse. The third is to look for industries that are suitable for all parties (policy support, high prosperity, good mass base, and broad future development prospects) as breakthrough opportunities. During this period, it can be said that the demons were in chaos, market values were lost, and the main thread was unclear. We suggest: For this kind of speculation, we can participate with a small amount of money, conduct short-term behavior, and move in and out quickly, but we must not think that this is the normal state of the market. Currently there are fundamentals: 1. Huawei industry chain. 2. Media, short drama video category. 3. Artificial intelligence computing power category. Real estate is only a short-term stimulus provided by policy, and its development possibilities are already slim. Therefore, we firmly believe that this is the initial stage of the big bottom building process. Secondly, we explore opportunities around the three main lines with fundamental foundations. Third, treat this kind of nonsense speculation calmly! Welcome to follow me Gong Zhonghao &quot;Lao Ji Zaoshen&quot;, and you can get many big gift packages and surprises.

Every morning, the good news is that the FBM A50 futures index will quickly rise and then open. Then it will either rush higher and then go lower, or it will open lower and go lower. Today is the latter. One or two large-capitalization heavyweight stocks should be left in the market to protect the market, so as not to cause the market to fall too much. Banks and oil are the ones that shine today. Their gains are not big, but their symbolic significance is great. Second, main funds continue to have a large net outflow. This morning, the net outflow of main funds in the market was 8.7 billion yuan, and the Shenzhen market reached an astonishing 20.2 billion yuan. The two cities totaled 30.9 billion yuan, almost catching up with yesterday&#39;s full-day level of 35.7 billion yuan. There was no sector with a net inflow of more than 300 million yuan throughout the morning. Diet pills, traditional Chinese medicine, community group buying, etc. had a net inflow of more than 250 million yuan. Huawei Concept had a significant net outflow of 8.2 billion yuan, and new energy vehicles had a net outflow of 7.8 billion yuan. The net outflows of artificial intelligence, domestic chips, etc. all exceeded 5.5 billion yuan. As far as the main positions are concerned, there was a large net outflow of 8.44 billion yuan from institutions and 4 billion yuan from funds today, which shows that these two main institutions are selling. Judging from the capital situation of New Lithium Scenery, it is also the target of major fund selling today. Lithium batteries alone were sold for 4.7 billion yuan. Third, the current trading volume situation of the market is relatively complicated. In the short term, it is now a trend of heavy volume and stagflation. This reminds me of March 2021, when the market was also in a stagflation of heavy volume. The volume at that time was even greater than it is now. But it won’t rise. Why won’t it rise? Because domestic funds banded together to pursue the new lithium glory held by foreign investors, the results were very disappointing. From a recent perspective, the trading volume of 1.066 billion yuan on November 6 is the ceiling for this month. Since then, the market has not exceeded this level on a single trading day, but the market has hit 3,080 points twice, including hitting a new high of 3,089 points yesterday. , the volume energy is 990 billion yuan. Compared with the volume energy on November 6, this trend is shrinking to a new high, a trend of divergence between volume and price, and a pump-and-dump. Many people don’t understand what pump-and-dump is. , I am not talking nonsense, it is based on trading volume and the law of volume and price. Fourth, the Beijing Stock Exchange has risen sharply, rising by 3.55% again this morning. I would like to ask: Does it have anything to do with most retail investors? This can only show that short-term funds no longer play on the main board, but go elsewhere. This also provides a signal to our retail investors: most of the main players have successfully absconded and left the main board to retail investors. Aren’t many people looking forward to a big bull market? ? Then just wait, there will definitely be one, I don’t know when it will come. In short, the market is currently in a high-volume and shipping trend. Some people always ask me, is 3,000 points still a high level? I don&#39;t want to answer such a question. Second, no matter what the trend is in the afternoon, everyone must remain highly vigilant, wait patiently for the market adjustment to be completed, and do not act rashly. For the short-term hot spots that appear every day, such as the recent short drama concept, most retail investors did not participate in the early stage, and did not even know that such a concept existed. Now that the speculation is high, people all over the world are saying how good it is, just to let retail investors take over. Just like the weight-loss drugs in the early stage, and going forward like artificial intelligence, the Star Flash concept and other trends, there is a price but no market. The main force will fight against it by itself, waiting for the majority of retail investors to take a look. Regarding the trends of these sectors, retail investors who do not have short-term skills should not participate rashly and be aware of the risks. The adjustment of the market is currently underway, so don’t just rush in and wait for the rise to make big money after listening to some encouraging words. A-shares never believe in tears! You must wait for the short-term adjustment of the A-share market to be completed before making plans, selecting targets, finding low points, making a little profit and running, taking a shot and changing places. This is the best operation method under the current market situation. Don&#39;t have any illusions. I have already talked a lot about the trend of the market in the afternoon in yesterday&#39;s article, so I won&#39;t go into details today.

325,"Fed officials showed no urgency to further raise interest rates] But the minutes of the Fed&#39;s November meeting also showed that interest rate policymakers agreed that policy must remain &quot;restrictive.&quot; Lagarde warned that the ECB&#39;s work to combat inflation is not over yet] Europe The central banker pushed back on expectations of a spring interest rate cut. Britain establishes artificial intelligence task force to streamline civil service] British Deputy Prime Minister Dowden said that the new department is a panacea in improving efficiency for taxpayers. The latest data released by the State Grain and Material Reserves Bureau shows that so far, the main production areas have purchased more than 60 million tons of autumn grain. This year, many places have taken measures such as online reservations and setting up grain post-harvest service centers to improve grain harvesting efficiency and ensure smooth and orderly grain harvesting. Although recently released data shows that the U.S. economic growth is strong, this is increasingly failing to convince the Federal Reserve. To further understand the economic situation in the United States, the Federal Reserve has begun on-site surveys to gain a more intuitive understanding of the economic situation through anecdotal data fed back by business managers and consumers. I checked, Americans have also learned to investigate tobacco and alcohol. Minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting: Reiterate caution and require more evidence to change the interest rate stance] The minutes stated that all policymakers agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain restrictive monetary policy for a period of time until inflation clearly declines significantly toward the target; if the information received suggests that inflation has been achieved The progress towards the goal is not enough, and it is suitable to further tighten the currency; policymakers still believe that there are risks of upward inflation and economic downturn. The upward risk of inflation has added geopolitics, and the economic downward risk has added new risks. The impact of the tightening of the credit environment has exceeded expectations, and the global oil market has been affected by Interference; two consecutive meetings did not mention &quot;recession&quot; at all. Federal Reserve staff still believe that economic expectations are highly uncertain, warning that the fragility of the financial system is still significant, and stock market and commercial real estate valuations are high; some participants reiterated that even if interest rates begin to be cut The balance sheet may also be reduced for a period of time. &quot;New Fed News Service&quot; said that Fed officials are unwilling to conclude that they have completed raising interest rates, but they may be willing to keep interest rates unchanged at least this year. Commentators said the minutes were hawkish but moving towards neutral. The Federal Reserve&#39;s November FOMC minutes did not hint at an interest rate cut, and officials unanimously agreed to maintain interest rate restrictions for a period of time. U.S. stocks fell off their highs in more than three months and hit a new low since 2010, while housing prices hit a new high and year-on-year increases expanded.] U.S. existing home sales fell for the fifth consecutive month in October to an annualized rate of 3.79 million units, a new low since 2010. The median price of homes sold in October was $391,800, up 3.4% from October last year. Year-on-year growth in home prices has expanded for four consecutive months.

The central bank launched a 460 billion yuan 7-day reverse repurchase operation today] Securities Times e Company reported that the central bank launched a 460 billion yuan 7-day reverse repurchase operation today, and the winning rate was 1.80%, the same as before. Today, 495 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repos expired. The Japanese government lowered its monthly economic assessment for the first time since January, reflecting concerns about the global economic outlook. In the November economic report, Japan&#39;s Cabinet Office continued to say that the economy was recovering at a moderate pace, but noted that part of the recovery had been paused recently. The government lowered its assessment of business spending for the first time in nearly two years, while not raising any estimates for other components of the economy. We continue to believe that exports are picking up, factory production is showing signs of recovery, and corporate profits have improved overall. China Index Research Institute: It is expected that measures related to stabilizing housing prices and promoting demand will be further implemented] November 22 news, according to Yicai, the China Index Research Institute recently held a meeting in Beijing &quot;2024 China Real Estate Market Trends and Investment and Financing Strategies Closed Seminar&quot;. Zhongzhi said that under neutral assumptions, the sales area of commercial housing nationwide will decrease by about 5% in 2024. If the economy continues to recover, the willingness to buy homes improves, and the transformation of urban villages proceeds as scheduled, the sales scale may achieve a slight increase. Restrictive policies introduced during the overheating stage of the market are expected to continue to be optimized in 2024 to better support the release of reasonable housing demand. The current willingness of home buyers to purchase a home is weak, residents&#39; income expectations have not yet recovered, and strong expectations of housing prices falling are still key factors restricting the release of demand for home purchases. It is expected that measures related to stabilizing housing prices and promoting demand will be further implemented. In the past two years, the scale of land transactions has shrunk significantly, existing inventory is high, and corporate financial pressures are still under pressure. Factors such as this may continue to hinder new construction starts by enterprises. The scale of new construction starts by real estate companies in 2024 may continue to decline year-on-year. On the 22nd, Beijing building materials prices fell. 10. The current threads are Ф18-25: Chenggang and Legang 3890; seismic plate screws Ф8-10: Chenggang and Legang 4100. On the 22nd, the quotation of Shanghai building materials fell by 10, Zhongtian 4030, Yonggang 4060, Yonggang plate screw 4330. 22 The price of construction steel in Taiyuan, Japan is stable, and the quotations for large threads from mainstream steel mills are as follows: Shougang and Jingang are quoted at 3980; Meijin, Jianlong, Jianbang, Jingye, Xingbao and other steel mills are quoted at 3930-3950. As of November 22, a total of five central construction enterprises announced their newly signed contract values from January to October. The total newly signed contract value was approximately 5,768.399 billion yuan, an increase of 8.59% compared with the same period last year (5,312.22 billion yuan). Recently, there has been a change in the short-term transportation of Mongolian coal. Judging from the short-term freight rate, Chaganhada Yiganqimao has been in a V-shape in the past three days, first diving from 460+ to 190+, and then rising to 240+ yesterday. It is understood that the four large-scale Mongolian coal trading companies have taken some measures related to the irrational short-term freight prices in the past, which followed the rise in coal prices, and the large price difference between coal prices in the bidding process. Whether it can be achieved in the future The expected effect remains to be seen. It is also understood that although the number of port customs clearances has increased recently, the pallets in the hands of small and medium-sized central merchants are limited. The coking coal market in Taiyuan continues to be strong. On November 22, the price of low-sulfur main coking coal in the Gujiao area of Taiyuan, Shanxi was raised again by 50%. Yuan/ton, after the increase, the ex-factory exchange rate of low-sulfur main coking coal (S0.5G85) is 2,450 yuan/ton, and the price this month has been increased by a total of 250 yuan/ton. The continued rise in iron ore prices has attracted the attention of relevant departments. In the short term, iron ore futures prices may be affected to some extent and fall back. However, with the increase in blast furnace operating rates of steel companies and low iron ore port inventories, most coke companies Limit production by 40%~50%. The coking coal market quotations have risen sharply, and the production costs of coking companies have increased. Some coking companies intend to increase their metallurgical coke quotations for a second round, but steel companies are not very receptive due to poor profitability. Affected by individual coal mine accidents, all Lishi coal mines in Luliang, Shanxi, suspended production pending inspections, but production quickly resumed after inspections. Coking coal downstream companies are actively purchasing, and some have increased their purchases. Some coal mining companies in Jinzhong, Luliang, Linfen, and Changzhi are optimistic about the market outlook and have suspended orders. As the price of finished materials rises, steel mills&#39; profits are also constantly improving, and short-term processes have become fully profitable. The long-term smoothness has also improved significantly, and it is expected that the follow-up will have a certain boost to production. In October 2023, China imported 7.9796 million tons of coking coal, accounting for 22.17% of the total coal imports, a month-on-month decrease of 26.28%, and a year-on-year increase of 28.54%. Coking coal imports have dropped back to the level of the second quarter, and imports from all countries have declined to varying degrees except Australia. Specifically, Mongolia and Russia are still the main importers of coking coal, and are the only two countries that exceed one million tons. The two imported a total of 5.6774 million tons, accounting for 71.15%, basically the same as in September. I wrote yesterday Xiangang was clearly proved by the main player today.

326,"Some knowledge can be gained from stock trading. The stock market is nothing static. Or, if you want to argue, 3,000 points will remain unchanged for more than ten years. But if you look back, it won&#39;t be like this in 10 years. This requires a large number of technology stocks to take up index share. Thus replacing the old bank, real estate and other bills. When doing stocks in the future, look at two directions. To be conservative, look at the aging of the population. For those who are more aggressive, look at technological changes. Even passers-by know the technological gap between China and the United States. In the stock market, artificial intelligence has taken turns to be hyped. This actually makes sense. When trading stocks, you must respect the market. Find out why. About the margin of safety for stocks. Don&#39;t worry about stocks, safety first. That is to compare the price-earnings ratio and net profit growth rate. There are still great risks involved in speculating on castles in the air. . . . . . .

The United States announced the first R&amp;D investment in the &quot;Chip Act&quot; targeting the advanced packaging industry. The U.S. chip and semiconductor sector has continued to rise, but the domestic chip and semiconductor sector has continued to decline. 2. Guangdong: Support Guangzhou and Shenzhen in promoting the construction of the National New Generation Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Development Pilot Zone and the National Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Application Pilot Zone.

On the one hand, interest rate hikes and geopolitical risks have had a huge impact on the global economy, leading to slower economic growth, rising inflation, intensified debt crises, and increased social instability. On the other hand, the development of the digital economy, low-carbon economy and regional value chains has brought new impetus to the global economy, promoted the optimization of the economic structure, and created new business models and employment opportunities. In such a turbulent era, the trend of the global economy will depend on how governments and central banks respond to crises and seize opportunities. How to coordinate interests? First, the growth rate of the global economy in 2024 will be slower than in 2023, but will still remain at a relatively moderate level. It is predicted that the global GDP growth rate will drop slightly to 2.8% in 2024 from about 3% in 2023. This is mainly due to the following four reasons: 1. Geographical risks have caused supply shocks to the global economy, causing economic activities to not fully return to normal levels, but to remain in an inefficient state. For example, frictions between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts between Palestine and Israel have brought uncertainty and disruption to global energy supply and trade. 2. The aging of the population in major economies around the world is becoming more and more serious, resulting in a reduction in labor supply and a decline in potential growth rate. For example, the Eurozone has a much older population than the United States, making its economic growth slower and sluggish. 3. In order to control inflation, major central banks around the world continue to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policies, leading to a contraction in credit and a drag on economic growth. For example, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times in 2023 and is expected to raise interest rates twice more in 2024, which will increase the real interest rate level in the United States and have a suppressive effect on investment and consumption. 4. Although global trade conditions will improve in 2024 as the global supply chain is repaired, global trade growth will still be difficult to return to normal levels because global trade protectionism and unilateralism still exist, and global trade rules and order remain. Unstable. For example, the trade friction between the United States and China has not been fundamentally resolved, and the trade dispute between the United States and the European Union has not been properly handled. Secondly, the global economic environment in 2024 will be very sensitive and easily affected by uncertain events. On the one hand, the slowdown in economic growth will inevitably be accompanied by an intensification of the game of interests. Competition and conflicts among countries will become more intense, and global governance and cooperation will become more difficult. For example, the United States will usher in a presidential election in 2024, which will affect the domestic and foreign policies of the United States, as well as the global political and economic landscape. On the other hand, in 2024, the relationship between global inflation and employment will undergo major changes, which will affect the policy orientation and market expectations of major global central banks. In 2024, the relationship between global inflation and employment will slip from the steepest part to the concave part. This means that in order to reduce inflation, more employment will need to be sacrificed, unemployment will rise, and economic growth will slow down. This will force the world&#39;s major central banks to shift from focusing on inflation to focusing on employment, from tightening policy to easing policy, and from hawkish to dovish. This policy shift will lead to increased market sensitivity to macro policies and increased financial market volatility. For example, if the Fed&#39;s policy changes are less than market expectations, U.S. bond yields and the U.S. dollar exchange rate may fluctuate significantly, which will have an impact on global asset prices. In addition, the structure of the global economy will undergo profound changes in 2024, which will bring new risks and opportunities to the global economy. On the one hand, risk factors still exist and require vigilance and prevention. For example, the debt levels of some countries around the world are too high, and the risk of debt crisis is still high. Especially in the context of rising global interest rates, debt repayment pressure will increase. At the same time, some major emerging market countries will face structural challenges in the labor market, including population aging, skills shortages, and rising unemployment, which will affect the quality and efficiency of economic growth, as well as social stability and harmony. On the other hand, opportunities are also emerging that need to be seized and exploited. For example, the development of digital economy and low-carbon economy will provide new impetus for global economic growth, promote the optimization of economic structure, and create new business models and employment opportunities. In 2024, major breakthroughs will be made in the fields of artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and environmental protection technology, which will accelerate the application of artificial intelligence in various industries, improve energy utilization efficiency, and reduce environmental pollution. In addition, the reorganization of global supply chains will also bring new opportunities to the global economy. Due to the intensification of geopolitical risks, the global regional value chain system is taking shape, and more companies will re-evaluate their supply chain strategies to adapt to the new geopolitical landscape and economic competition environment. This will promote intra-regional trade and investment and improve The level of economic integration within the region. To sum up, the global economy in 2024 will show three major characteristics: &quot;slow growth, high sensitivity, and deep transformation.&quot; This is an era of both tests and opportunities for governments and central banks of all countries. For those who are unintentional, this means dangers abound; for those who are prepared, it means endless opportunities. What do you think of it?

344,"AI Artificial Intelligence - Sickle: The self-proclaimed &quot;AI boss&quot; PK chases the big model - Leek: Investors Sickle and Leek - the eternal theme of the stock market is enduring. As the industry has been cold, since receiving a new round of financing in December last year, Shenlan Technology has not received financing in nearly 7 months. As the acquirer, Shenlan Technology was still seeking financing from investment institutions on the eve of Huamai Technology’s private placement plan. It is currently seeking approximately 80 million yuan in financing, but has been denied by the company. Use 50 million of your own funds to leverage a 400 million bank loan to purchase control of a listed company. Will Shenlan Technology be incorporated into the listed company in the next step to achieve a backdoor listing? With the emergence of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has been pushed to a higher level of focus in the capital market. It is this kind of imagination that has allowed Huamai Technology, with a market value of less than 3 billion, to hit the daily limit 6 times in a row. As the core operating platform of this transaction, Shenlan Holdings looks like a company specially set up to take over Huamai Technology. It was founded on March 21, 2023 and has not yet carried out substantive operating activities. However, there is still little information about the counterparty Shenlan Holdings. Judging from the source of funds from 50 million of its own funds to leverage 400 million of M&amp;A loans, the financial strength is questionable! The Shanghai Stock Exchange asked: About 80% of the funds required for this private placement come from bank loans. Whether it can be promoted will heavily rely on bank credit, resulting in significant uncertainty in the results of this private placement and the transfer of control rights? Nearly 80% of the acquisition funds come from bank loans, indicating that the acquirer lacks financial capabilities and does not rule out the possibility of speculation! There are not many private placements in the market that end without problems. Investors should avoid blindly following the trend to avoid the risk of stock price speculation. Conflicting information disclosure, investors beware of risks.

346,"Computing power! Recently, the daily trading volume of the Beijing Stock Exchange has reached a record high, and the average position of domestic private equity institutions has remained at around 80% for many consecutive weeks. The regulatory authorities have drawn up a “white list” of 50 real estate companies to support the healthy development of high-quality real estate companies. In addition, Guangdong issued a three-year action plan for the construction of a &quot;Digital Bay Area&quot; to promote the development of the digital economy. Huawei NR Transmission has completed the in-orbit test of the LEO regeneration satellite, which is an important breakthrough for Huawei in the field of space communications. At the same time, Baidu has decided to open Wenxinyiyan to the whole society in the past three months, which is another important step for Baidu in the field of artificial intelligence. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, computing power has gradually become an important force in promoting economic growth and social progress. In this context, the oversold computing power should perform well in the future. When sentiment and index both peak, the market will inevitably move up and down. Judging from the current situation, the best direction to cut high and low is computing power. First of all, we need to recognize the widespread application and rapid development of computing power technology, as well as the important role of computing power in promoting economic growth and social progress. With the advent of the digital age, computing power technology has penetrated into various fields, such as medical care, finance, manufacturing, education, etc. The application of computing power technology can improve efficiency, reduce costs, optimize resource allocation, and bring huge business value to all walks of life. Secondly, we need to recognize the investment value of the computing power sector in the current market environment. With the country&#39;s strong support for technological innovation and the introduction of various policies, the computing power industry will usher in a broader space for development. At the same time, the continuous breakthroughs and innovations in computing power technology have also increased the investment potential of the computing power sector. Therefore, in the long term, the investment value of the computing power sector is worth looking forward to. However, we also need to be aware of the investment risks in the computing power sector under the current market environment. At present, the valuation of the computing power sector is relatively high, and the market has certain concerns about the commercialization and application prospects of computing power technology. In addition, the research and development and application of computing power technology require a large amount of capital and human resource investment, which also increases the investment risk in the computing power sector. Therefore, investors need to comprehensively consider the investment value and risk factors of the computing power sector. During the investment process, you need to pay attention to factors such as the development trend of computing power technology, policy environment, and commercial application prospects, and at the same time make investment decisions based on your own risk tolerance and investment goals. In addition, it is also necessary to maintain a rational and calm attitude and avoid blindly following the trend and excessive speculation. Finally, we also need to realize the importance of the development of computing technology to the country and society. Computing technology is one of the core driving forces of the new generation of scientific and technological revolution. It has important strategic significance in promoting economic development, improving people&#39;s lives, and enhancing national competitiveness. Therefore, governments, enterprises and all sectors of society need to work together to promote the innovation and application of computing power technology and achieve sustainable economic and social development. In short, in the current market environment, the investment value of the computing power sector is worthy of attention. But at the same time, you also need to be aware of investment risks and challenges. We need to maintain a rational and calm attitude and conduct comprehensive investment analysis and decision-making to maximize investment returns. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to the development trends and application prospects of computing power technology, actively participate in and support the development of the computing power industry, and contribute to the sustainable development of the economy and society.

Coming to the battlefield for most of us, the Shanghai Composite Index is suppressed by the 60-day moving average. At present, there is still some pressure. There is no way to be bullish in this place. At least there must be a big positive line before we can take a position.

[Exclusive Perspective] The improvement of Sino-US relations is expected to benefit the export industry to the United States, especially the previously impacted exports to the United States. my country has global competitiveness and high-value high-end manufacturing. Opportunities for the convergence of Sino-US interest rate differentials and the replenishment of foreign investment have already Coming, the convergence of the A-share valuation gap has basically been completed. As U.S. inflation declines and the U.S. dollar index weakens, the market continues to trade &quot;the end of the Fed&#39;s interest rate hikes&quot; and global risk assets are breathing a sigh of relief; therefore, in terms of allocation, the defense is solid Next, we will gradually allocate technology tracks with high offensive growth potential, such as: ① The rebound of growth industries with potential will benefit from abundant liquidity and shortage of computing power supply during the year, and will alleviate the slow-paced and repeatedly catalyzed TMT (electronics, computers, media) ) ② More flexible sectors such as semiconductors and automobiles that are catalyzed by industrial cycles are repeatedly tracked using tripartite indicators.

352,"Can the three major news in the evening bottom out and rebound today? Yesterday, the market fell in heavy volume in the last hour. External stock markets generally fell. Chinese concept stocks generally fell. The Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index fell by more than 2%. The news was calm. The market should open lower today. When it dips, focus on the support near 3050 points, with strong support around 3037 points. When it pulls back, focus on the pressure near 3080 points, with strong pressure around 3090 points. Yesterday morning, the trend of the market was relatively stable. As funds moved to the Beijing Stock Exchange, the market began to dive, filling the upward gap of the day. Strictly speaking, this trend is in line with our analysis, because we have repeatedly reminded it in the intraday analysis. Yesterday&#39;s upward gap is an ordinary gap and needs to be filled. Therefore, the overall advice yesterday was to be more cautious. Why do funds move to the Beijing Stock Exchange? We have already analyzed yesterday’s closing article, but here is a reminder that the speculation of individual stocks on the North Exchange should not be over. The main reason is that the North Exchange has no financing, no quantitative funds, and is a pure and large land. This is a bit like the original hype. For convertible bonds, as funds begin to gather in the North Exchange, everyone must pay attention to the risks, because the North Exchange is all small-cap stocks, which are easy to rise, but even easier to fall. The key is that there is no trading volume, making it difficult to escape. In the evening, there was a correction in the external stock markets. The FTSE A50 fell slightly and the RMB continued to appreciate. However, Chinese concept stocks fell sharply. Will the market bottom out and rebound today? 1. There are multiple benefits for technology stocks, mainly concentrated in the directions of computing power, chips, semiconductors, etc. Today, stocks in these directions are expected to rebound: 1. Guangdong: Support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges to establish national-level data exchanges. It is good for big data, eastern and western computing, computing power and other sectors; 2. Guangdong: Support Guangzhou and Shenzhen in promoting the construction of the national new generation artificial intelligence innovation and development pilot zone and the national artificial intelligence innovation application pilot zone. It is good for the direction of artificial intelligence. When the market plunged yesterday, artificial intelligence rose against the trend, which should be an early reaction to this news. 3. The United States announced US$3 billion to fund the advanced packaging industry. Who is this funding targeted at? As long as everyone knows it well! Therefore, domestic substitution will also accelerate, benefiting chips, semiconductors and other related sectors. 4. Huawei Chairman’s latest statement: Computing power has become the core productivity of the digital economy. It is good for the direction of computing power. 2. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast is higher than expected, but it is worried about a sharp decline in sales in China. Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue was US$18.12 billion, analysts expected US$16.09 billion; third-quarter data center revenue was US$14.51 billion; analysts It is expected to be US$12.82 billion; fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be US$20 billion, plus or minus no more than 2%, and analysts expected US$17.9 billion. It is normal for NVIDIA to announce higher-than-expected results, because NVIDIA H100 is so popular, and chips and computing power caused by artificial intelligence are in short supply. However, NVIDIA&#39;s stock price has reached a record high, and it has fulfilled its previous performance, so After the announcement of Nvidia&#39;s results, it fell by more than 6% after the market closed. However, it has basically recovered all the losses and is now down by about 1%. This is mainly due to the fact that a castrated version of H20 will be sold in China in the future, and there are expectations for the market. 3. Moutai Cocktails Launch According to Moutai’s official website, on November 20, the “Guizhou Taste” series of cocktails jointly developed by Moutai Ecological Agriculture Company and MOJT was officially released. Moutai Group stated that the &quot;MOJT&quot; series of cocktails launched this time are an important attempt made by Moutai Youmi to conform to the trends of health, youth, fashion and urbanization and promote the transformation from &quot;selling wine&quot; to &quot;selling lifestyle&quot; . Moutai is also working hard for performance! From coffee to chocolate to now cocktails, they are all designed to inspire young people to consume, but will young people buy it? The point is that Moutai&#39;s price has increased. The stock price has opened high and moved low, and then it paid a large dividend. Yesterday it closed in the red. If it launches a cocktail today, will Moutai be at the end of its rope? Everyone will wait and see, but one thing is for sure, everyone has no money and cannot afford to spend!

357,"Yesterday, the market fell in heavy volume in the last hour. External stock markets generally fell. Chinese concept stocks generally fell. The Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index fell by more than 2%. The news was calm. The market should open lower today. When it dips, focus on the support near 3050 points, with strong support around 3037 points. When it pulls back, focus on the pressure near 3080 points, with strong pressure around 3090 points. Yesterday morning, the trend of the market was relatively stable. As funds moved to the Beijing Stock Exchange, the market began to dive, filling the upward gap of the day. Strictly speaking, this trend is in line with our analysis, because we have repeatedly reminded it in the intraday analysis. Yesterday&#39;s upward gap is an ordinary gap and needs to be filled. Therefore, the overall advice yesterday was to be more cautious. Why do funds move to the Beijing Stock Exchange? We have already analyzed yesterday’s closing article, but here is a reminder that the speculation of individual stocks on the North Exchange should not be over. The main reason is that the North Exchange has no financing, no quantitative funds, and is a pure and large land. This is a bit like the original hype. For convertible bonds, as funds begin to gather in the North Exchange, everyone must pay attention to the risks, because the North Exchange is all small-cap stocks, which are easy to rise, but even easier to fall. The key is that there is no trading volume, making it difficult to escape. In the evening, there was a correction in the external stock markets. The FTSE A50 fell slightly and the RMB continued to appreciate. However, Chinese concept stocks fell sharply. Will the market bottom out and rebound today? 1. There are multiple benefits for technology stocks, mainly concentrated in the directions of computing power, chips, semiconductors, etc. Today, stocks in these directions are expected to rebound: 1. Guangdong: Support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges to establish national-level data exchanges. It is good for big data, eastern and western computing, computing power and other sectors; 2. Guangdong: Support Guangzhou and Shenzhen in promoting the construction of the national new generation artificial intelligence innovation and development pilot zone and the national artificial intelligence innovation application pilot zone. It is good for the direction of artificial intelligence. When the market plunged yesterday, artificial intelligence rose against the trend, which should be an early reaction to this news. 3. The United States announced US$3 billion to fund the advanced packaging industry. Who is this funding targeted at? As long as everyone knows it well! Therefore, domestic substitution will also accelerate, benefiting chips, semiconductors and other related sectors. 4. Huawei Chairman’s latest statement: Computing power has become the core productivity of the digital economy. It is good for the direction of computing power. 2. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast is higher than expected, but it is worried about a sharp decline in sales in China. Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue was US$18.12 billion, analysts expected US$16.09 billion; third-quarter data center revenue was US$14.51 billion; analysts It is expected to be US$12.82 billion; fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be US$20 billion, plus or minus no more than 2%, and analysts expected US$17.9 billion. It is normal for NVIDIA to announce higher-than-expected results, because NVIDIA H100 is so popular, and chips and computing power caused by artificial intelligence are in short supply. However, NVIDIA&#39;s stock price has reached a record high, and it has fulfilled its previous performance, so After the announcement of Nvidia&#39;s results, it fell by more than 6% after the market closed. However, it has basically recovered all the losses and is now down by about 1%. This is mainly due to the fact that a castrated version of H20 will be sold in China in the future, and there are expectations for the market. 3. Moutai Cocktails Launch According to Moutai’s official website, on November 20, the “Guizhou Taste” series of cocktails jointly developed by Moutai Ecological Agriculture Company and MOJT was officially released. Moutai Group stated that the &quot;MOJT&quot; series of cocktails launched this time are an important attempt made by Moutai Youmi to conform to the trends of health, youth, fashion and urbanization and promote the transformation from &quot;selling wine&quot; to &quot;selling lifestyle&quot; . Moutai is also working hard for performance! From coffee to chocolate to now cocktails, they are all designed to inspire young people to consume, but will young people buy it? The point is that Moutai&#39;s price has increased. The stock price has opened high and moved low, and then it paid a large dividend. Yesterday it closed in the red. If it launches a cocktail today, will Moutai be at the end of its rope? Everyone will wait and see, but one thing is for sure, everyone has no money and cannot afford to spend! Technically, the market surged higher and fell back yesterday, indicating that the market is under pressure in the area near 3100 points. Considering that various indicators still need to be repaired, the market still has a process of inertial retracement. Let&#39;s first look at the support near the 30-day line.

358,"Sentiment + disk double peak and bottom buying, this sector is about to become the new main line (refer to 11-22 in the morning review) on Tuesday, the index shot up and fell back, and the main index closed in the green. The pressure above 3100 points on the Shanghai Stock Index is relatively obvious, and at the same time, the 60-day moving average resistance resonates. The pressure is a little higher on Wednesday and Thursday. There are repetitions here, but the trend is no problem. However, the amount of energy close to one trillion can maintain the current position shock and hot spot rotation. Real estate, online consumption, short dramas, etc. are active on the market, and technology stocks are among the top losers. In the short term, as the sentiment and index levels of consecutive highs have both peaked, high-priced stocks have the potential to compensate for losses, and the market will have a high-low logic. In the short term, this wave of chip market is coming to an end. Yinbaoshan’s new 8-board market can be regarded as a small cycle suppression that breaks through the seven-board market, but there is no assist from the lower echelon of the sector. Wenyi Technology, which has high core standards, can only maintain high fluctuations under the 30-day 200% regulatory suppression. This is in the ebb phase of a small cycle. The market for computing power leasing has also come to an end. Hengwei Technology in the front row has dropped by the limit, and Zhongbei Communications, the core of the trend, has fluctuated at a high level. If these high marks are not breached again this week. On the contrary, here you can pay attention to oversold AI. Many stocks that have fallen in this direction have made solid bottoms, and there has been some cooperation in the news. When sentiment and indexes both peak, the market will inevitably experience high and low cuts, and look for breakthroughs in the low direction with higher cost performance. As far as the current situation is concerned, It seems that the best direction for cutting high and low is AI. The core point of artificial intelligence is still optimistic about computing power.

362,"231122V+ member·Research report &quot;Open high and move low/Differences between long and short increase the volume game/Closing green and shorts dominate&quot; --- Analyzes the 30-minute technical trends of the Shanghai Composite Index and GEM for Week 2, and the strong rebound of U.S. stocks overnight showed bands Affected by the new high, the three major stock indexes jumped slightly in early trading, opening higher and moving higher. After the Shanghai Composite broke through the previous high, it made a slight correction and fluctuated. It dived in the afternoon, covered the gap, and turned green. The Shanghai Composite Index fell slightly by 0.01% to 3067.93 points, the Shenzhen Component Index fell by 0.26% to 9997.09 points, the ChiNext Index fell by 0.44% to 1984.27 points, the Shanghai Composite 50 Index rose by 0.48%, and the Beixin 50 Index was independently strong, rising by 4.5%; both markets saw heavy volume Nearly one trillion yuan, with a total transaction volume of 998.1 billion yuan. Northbound funds flowed in significantly during the day, but quickly left the market at the end of the day. Net purchases were 142 million yuan. The real estate, media, and home furnishing sectors strongly pulled up to protect the market, and winemaking. Semiconductor, military industry, brokerage and other sectors were weak. Individual stocks fell more than they rose, with 3,364 stocks falling. The average share price fell by 0.19%. Judging from the market trend on Tuesday, the main bulls took the opportunity to achieve a partial breakthrough in the band rebound, but they had no choice but to follow up and lacked the strength. Northbound funds also made a contribution during the intraday trading, but due to the excessive pressure from above, they took the opportunity to make short-term profits and unwind the arbitrage. The trading volume of nearly one trillion yuan shows that the bulls have made considerable efforts, and it also shows that the differences between long and short have increased. The final close was dominated by shorts, making the rebound full of variables. In other words, the long-short game will become more intense in the later period, and the market direction will be highly uncertain. See below for specific trend structure positioning. The ideal result is that another thorough laundering of chips before the end of the year will shake up the chips and hold on to the chips that are eager to exit, and a large number of hands will be changed at low positions. In this way, the Xiaojin Pit is at the bottom and the Spring Festival Red Envelope Quote/Spring Quote will be easy to enter. The accumulation of policy stimulus in the early stage, the strong start and improvement of the real economy, the festive atmosphere, and the entry of year-end bonuses into the market... market expectations and consensus will explode. By then, the policy will be even more perfect with a little more rain and dew, and a few thousand pounds. 1. According to news on the 20th, multiple insiders revealed that the regulatory authorities clearly required at the symposium on the 17th that the growth rate of each bank’s own real estate loans should not be lower than the average real estate growth rate of the banking industry, and the growth rate of corporate loans to non-state-owned real estate enterprises The growth rate of real estate loans shall not be lower than the Bank&#39;s real estate growth rate, and the growth rate of individual mortgage loans to non-state-owned real estate enterprises shall not be lower than the Bank&#39;s mortgage growth rate. (Economic Observer Network) [Comment]: The property market is already a serious buyer’s market! The fundamental solution to the problem is the needs of residents and actual purchasing power. If this problem is not solved, how to save real estate companies will be nonsense! Your transformation from three red lines to three or more is actually an emergency medical treatment, or it may have a certain positive effect on unfinished buildings. However, the trend in the property market has greatly increased supply pressure, leading to a greater crisis of oversupply. If you need to go bankrupt, you will go bankrupt. If you are unfinished, you should be in debt with the bank, because the house is mortgaged to you and you lack financial supervision. Relevant departments should also avoid it. The off-plan housing and low down payment system are the root cause. Homebuyers cannot be held responsible. This kind of treatment of headaches and pains is an economic management with Chinese characteristics. When accumulation reaches a certain threshold, the crisis will inevitably be liquidated. Can the financial symposium be chicken soup to comfort the market, saying it is good? The market no longer believes in tears. . 2. On Tuesday, the central bank carried out a reverse repurchase operation of 319 billion yuan, with a net withdrawal of 105 billion yuan. A total of 1.761 billion reverse repurchases by the central bank will expire this week, of which 113 billion, 424 billion, 495 billion, 377 billion and 352 billion will expire respectively from Monday to Friday [Comment]: In fact, the central bank’s large reverse repurchase stock is under pressure has been the case in recent weeks. Although the previous spicy noodle sequel had a net investment of 600 billion, the market is still very fragile. The property market continues to cool down and fall significantly; the stock market is like a bucket that cannot be helped... The reason is that the additional issuance of 1 trillion special government bonds and the large-scale issuance of local bonds have drawn a lot of blood from the market. Some people regard it as a good thing. I don’t know what the logic is. Is it good for the White House to issue a large amount of U.S. debt? The domestic media criticizes it every day, and it is a &quot;major benefit&quot; for itself. Cutting interest rates and RRR cuts are good news, but why do they need to be cut? The economy is improving, does it need to drop? What truth does the large-scale reduction show? Just like the central bank&#39;s reverse repurchase, which continues to release a large amount of water, is it a good thing? Why must it be released? 3. Overseas buyers evacuate collectively! Bridgewater Dalio warns: U.S. debt is approaching a turning point for deterioration. On the 21st, Bridgewater founder Dalio said that as government debt grows faster than income, the financial situation of the United States is approaching an accelerating &quot;inflection point.&quot; The hole grows deeper as the U.S. government borrows more and more money to pay its debt without spending any less. &quot;The way it works can only continue to accelerate... We are in a phase of this acceleration, which creates supply and demand issues.&quot; Earlier, Fitch, one of the three major U.S. rating agencies, had downgraded the U.S. credit rating, and another authority Ratings agency Moody&#39;s also lowered its outlook on U.S. debt ratings this month. Dalio asked: &quot;As a country, do we have a good income statement and balance sheet - do we have more assets than liabilities? The worse it gets, the more long-term problems we&#39;re going to have. You can see it in the numbers. &quot;It&#39;s just a matter of numbers. We&#39;re getting close to that inflection point.&quot; Last year, the government added $1.7 trillion to the deficit to keep spending on pace. . [Comment]: The recent rebound in U.S. bonds is a normal market spiral rhythm. It is not that the U.S. debt crisis has been eliminated. On the contrary, the future crisis will be even greater. Dario&#39;s warning cannot be ignored. Unless the U.S. debt crisis triggers something special, this crisis cycle will not pass, it will not be countercyclical, and it will not be cross-cyclical. Master, please stay here. . Figure 1: 30-minute trend chart of the Shanghai Composite Index. The 30-minute trend of the Shanghai Composite Index on Tuesday increased first and then declined.

Sam Altman, who was fired by the board of directors, supports effective accelerationism and puts the promotion of artificial intelligence development first. ; The company’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever pays more attention to preventing the risks of AI and advocates the super-alignment of artificial intelligence. This is originally the thrust and braking force for human development of AI, and both are indispensable. Now Altman has obtained investors and almost all The support of employees has the absolute upper hand, and Saskville has already switched sides.&quot; He mentioned in the article: &quot;AI has just begun, and it is hard to imagine what is in its depth space today. China must speed up AI Research and development, in order to improve our vision and intention of understanding the deep space of AI. It is not only a matter of AI application driving economic development, but also maintaining the fundamentals of national security and the major interests in shaping the right to participate in the future of mankind. Now we are looking at how OpenAI There is a &quot;court fight&quot; between two young entrepreneurs, and the future development direction of AI seems to be determined by their struggle. This is not okay. So what does it mean? We can only accelerate our AI pace at that speed.

365,"NVIDIA, no matter how it goes down, it is really strong, which also illustrates the dominance of artificial intelligence. Big A is currently still a semiconductor, computing power, and short video landscape. The short video climaxed yesterday, so today I will focus on observation. My energy is mainly focused on finding high-tech jobs. Now there are only two stocks, which is much better than three stocks, and the energy is more concentrated. Hi-tech had the strongest performance among computing power stocks yesterday, which also illustrates the importance of domestic substitution. Compared with Zhongbei, which rents computing power from NVIDIA cards, Hengrun has more potential. This is why I like Hi-tech. The biggest advantage is that to put it simply, I prefer Huawei’s domestic computing power, and domestic products should be self-reliant.

369,"(Bloomberg, Washington) To reduce dependence on Asia’s semiconductor supply chain, the Biden administration has launched a multi-billion-dollar investment plan, hoping to seize the dominant position in advanced semiconductor packaging technology. Bloomberg reports that the Biden administration has launched a US$3 billion (S$4 billion) national advanced packaging manufacturing plan more than a year after the implementation of the Chip and Science Act, and recently assigned a person in charge of the project. people. US Deputy Secretary of Commerce Locascio said the plan aims to establish multiple large-scale packaging facilities by 2030 to reduce reliance on Asian supply chains that may pose &quot;unacceptable&quot; risks to US security. Further reading China’s Ministry of Commerce: The United States should lift its semiconductor export controls to China as soon as possible. The competition between China and the United States in advanced semiconductor packaging. Semiconductor packaging is a process in which tested wafers are processed into independent chips according to product models and functional requirements. It is commonly referred to in the industry as &quot;Backend&quot; manufacturing. This business used to be mainly outsourced to Asia. Intel data shows that the United States accounts for only 3% of global packaging capabilities. With the application of new technologies, the complexity of semiconductor packaging is rapidly increasing, making chip combination, stacking and performance improvement possible. The industry regards this as a turning point in the industry. Especially in the field of high-power semiconductors required for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, packaging is crucial. According to reports, China already has the largest number of &quot;back-end&quot; facilities in the world, including Jiangsu Changdian, the world&#39;s third-largest assembly and testing company. Data from the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association shows that China has 38% of the global assembly, testing and packaging market share, ranking first in the world.

However, from a structural point of view, the index still maintains a good upward trend. Next, pay close attention to the choice of index direction. The turnover in the two cities is close to one trillion yuan. The sharp rise in the North Securities 50 Index has led to a rebound in local sentiment, and the structural market situation has once again been interpreted. The sluggish growth of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Indexes is more of a technical adjustment after continuous rises. The index is expected to maintain a volatile upward rhythm after short-term consolidation. Various economic data in October show that domestic demand is still insufficient. Under the policy tone of &quot;cross-cyclical and counter-cyclical adjustment&quot;, fiscal policy will be proactive, and monetary policy will also be loosened. In addition, the current RMB exchange rate has returned to the level in August, and the constraints of exchange rate depreciation on monetary policy have been significantly eased. Coupled with the warming of relations between major powers in diplomacy, the trend of net northbound capital outflows may be alleviated to some extent. U.S. inflation data in October was lower than expected, reducing pressure on the U.S. to further tighten monetary policy. The fall in U.S. debt is conducive to the recovery of risk appetite in global capital markets. In terms of style, pay attention to switching between large and small cap styles, and focus on band operations! In terms of allocation, we focus on: first, focusing on the medical and biological sectors that were oversold in the early stage, especially CXO and innovative drugs, which will benefit from the downward trend in U.S. interest rates and institutional increases in positions; second, trend opportunities in Huawei&#39;s industrial chain; third, adapting to the emerging industry of artificial intelligence Trends and the technological growth track in the direction of domestic vigorously developing digital economy policies; fourth, the global semiconductor cycle is close to bottoming out + under the independent and controllable logic, we are optimistic about the opportunities in the semiconductor industry chain. ®️Harley Finance⚠️The above analysis is for reference only.

374,"Yesterday, the market fell in heavy volume in the last hour. External stock markets generally fell. Chinese concept stocks generally fell. The Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index fell by more than 2%. The news was calm. The market should open lower today. When it dips, focus on the support near 3050 points, with strong support around 3037 points. When it pulls back, focus on the pressure near 3080 points, with strong pressure around 3090 points. Yesterday morning, the trend of the market was relatively stable. As funds moved to the Beijing Stock Exchange, the market began to dive, filling the upward gap of the day. Strictly speaking, this trend is in line with our analysis, because we have repeatedly prompted us in the intraday analysis. Yesterday&#39;s upward gap is an ordinary gap and needs to be filled. Therefore, the overall advice yesterday was to be more cautious. Why do funds move to the Beijing Stock Exchange? We have already analyzed yesterday’s closing article, but here is a reminder that the speculation of individual stocks on the North Exchange should not be over. The main reason is that the North Exchange has no financing, no quantitative funds, and is a pure and large land. This is a bit like the original hype. For convertible bonds, as funds begin to gather in the North Exchange, everyone must pay attention to the risks, because the North Exchange is all small-cap stocks, which are easy to rise, but even easier to fall. The key is that there is no trading volume, making it difficult to escape. In the evening, there was a correction in the external stock markets. The FTSE A50 fell slightly and the RMB continued to appreciate. However, Chinese concept stocks fell sharply. Will the market bottom out and rebound today? 1. There are multiple benefits for technology stocks, mainly concentrated in the directions of computing power, chips, semiconductors, etc. Today, stocks in these directions are expected to rebound: 1. Guangdong: Support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges to establish national-level data exchanges. It is good for big data, eastern and western computing, computing power and other sectors; 2. Guangdong: Support Guangzhou and Shenzhen in promoting the construction of the national new generation artificial intelligence innovation and development pilot zone and the national artificial intelligence innovation application pilot zone. It is good for the direction of artificial intelligence. When the market plunged yesterday, artificial intelligence rose against the trend, which should be an early reaction to this news. 3. The United States announced US$3 billion to fund the advanced packaging industry. Who is this funding targeted at? As long as everyone knows it well! Therefore, domestic substitution will also accelerate, benefiting chips, semiconductors and other related sectors. 4. Huawei Chairman’s latest statement: Computing power has become the core productivity of the digital economy. It is good for the direction of computing power. 2. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast is higher than expected, but it is worried about a sharp decline in sales in China. Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue was US$18.12 billion, analysts expected US$16.09 billion; third-quarter data center revenue was US$14.51 billion; analysts It is expected to be US$12.82 billion; fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be US$20 billion, plus or minus no more than 2%, and analysts expected US$17.9 billion. It is normal for NVIDIA to announce higher-than-expected results, because NVIDIA H100 is so popular, and chips and computing power caused by artificial intelligence are in short supply. However, NVIDIA&#39;s stock price has reached a record high, and it has fulfilled its previous performance, so After the announcement of Nvidia&#39;s results, it fell by more than 6% after the market closed. However, it has basically recovered all the losses and is now down by about 1%. This is mainly due to the fact that a castrated version of H20 will be sold in China later, and there are expectations for the market. 3. Moutai Cocktails Launch According to Moutai’s official website, on November 20, the “Guizhou Taste” series of cocktails jointly developed by Moutai Ecological Agriculture Company and MOJT was officially released. Moutai Group stated that the &quot;MOJT&quot; series of cocktails launched this time are an important attempt made by Moutai Youmi to conform to the trends of health, youth, fashion and urbanization and promote the transformation from &quot;selling wine&quot; to &quot;selling lifestyle&quot; . Moutai is also working hard for performance! From coffee to chocolate to now cocktails, they are all designed to inspire young people to consume, but will young people buy it? The point is that Moutai&#39;s price has increased. The stock price has opened high and moved low, and then it paid a large dividend. Yesterday it closed in the red. If it launches a cocktail today, will Moutai be at the end of its rope?

Moutai is also working hard for performance! From coffee to chocolate to now cocktails, they are all designed to inspire young people to consume, but will young people buy it? The key point is that Moutai&#39;s price has increased. The stock price has opened high and moved low, and then it paid a large dividend. Yesterday it closed in the red. If it launches a cocktail today, will Moutai be at the end of its rope? Everyone will wait and see, but one thing is for sure, everyone has no money and cannot afford to spend! Technically, the market surged higher and fell back yesterday, indicating that the market is under pressure in the area near 3100 points. Considering that various indicators still need to be repaired, the market still has a process of inertial retracement. Let&#39;s first look at the support near the 30-day line. Overall, please be cautious and please pay attention to the short-term bull shopkeeper to avoid getting lost.

378,"Can the three major news in the evening bottom out and rebound today? Yesterday, the market fell in heavy volume in the last hour. External stock markets generally fell. Chinese concept stocks generally fell. The Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index fell by more than 2%. The news was calm. The market should open lower today. When it dips, focus on the support near 3050 points, with strong support around 3037 points. When it pulls back, focus on the pressure near 3080 points, with strong pressure around 3090 points. Yesterday morning, the trend of the market was relatively stable. As funds moved to the Beijing Stock Exchange, the market began to dive, filling the upward gap of the day. Strictly speaking, this trend is in line with our analysis, because we have repeatedly reminded it in the intraday analysis. Yesterday&#39;s upward gap is an ordinary gap and needs to be filled. Therefore, the overall advice yesterday was to be more cautious. Why do funds move to the Beijing Stock Exchange? We have already analyzed yesterday’s closing article, but here is a reminder that the speculation of individual stocks on the North Exchange should not be over. The main reason is that the North Exchange has no financing, no quantitative funds, and is a pure and large land. This is a bit like the original hype. For convertible bonds, as funds begin to gather in the North Exchange, everyone must pay attention to the risks, because the North Exchange is all small-cap stocks, which are easy to rise, but even easier to fall. The key is that there is no trading volume, making it difficult to escape. In the evening, there was a correction in the external stock markets. The FTSE A50 fell slightly and the RMB continued to appreciate. However, Chinese concept stocks fell sharply. Will the market bottom out and rebound today? 1. There are multiple benefits for technology stocks, mainly concentrated in the directions of computing power, chips, semiconductors, etc. Today, stocks in these directions are expected to rebound: 1. Guangdong: Support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges to establish national-level data exchanges. It is good for big data, eastern and western computing, computing power and other sectors; 2. Guangdong: Support Guangzhou and Shenzhen in promoting the construction of the national new generation artificial intelligence innovation and development pilot zone and the national artificial intelligence innovation application pilot zone. It is good for the direction of artificial intelligence. When the market plunged yesterday, artificial intelligence rose against the trend, which should be an early reaction to this news. 3. The United States announced US$3 billion to fund the advanced packaging industry. Who is this funding targeted at? As long as everyone knows it well! Therefore, domestic substitution will also accelerate, benefiting chips, semiconductors and other related sectors. 4. Huawei Chairman’s latest statement: Computing power has become the core productivity of the digital economy. It is good for the direction of computing power. 2. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast is higher than expected, but it is worried about a sharp decline in sales in China. Nvidia’s third-quarter revenue was US$18.12 billion, analysts expected US$16.09 billion; third-quarter data center revenue was US$14.51 billion; analysts It is expected to be US$12.82 billion; fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be US$20 billion, plus or minus no more than 2%, and analysts expected US$17.9 billion. It is normal for NVIDIA to announce higher-than-expected results, because NVIDIA H100 is so popular, and chips and computing power caused by artificial intelligence are in short supply. However, NVIDIA&#39;s stock price has reached a record high, and it has fulfilled its previous performance, so After the announcement of Nvidia&#39;s results, it fell by more than 6% after the market closed. However, it has basically recovered all the losses and is now down by about 1%. This is mainly due to the fact that a castrated version of H20 will be sold in China in the future, and there are expectations for the market. 3.

380,"Life is education, and family is school. Education expert Professor Zhu Yongxin once said: &quot;Almost all excellent children have the imprint of their parents; in all problem children, the reasons for their families can also be found.&quot; Family education is the foundation of the entire education chain. If a child&#39;s growth goes awry or there are problems with his upbringing, the parents are naturally to blame. Today, we take a closer look at 9 common misunderstandings in today’s family education to see if you have fallen into any of them. There is only tame education but no personality education. China Youth Daily conducted a survey on 2,000 teenagers and found that 48.4% of the children suffered from &quot;supporting role syndrome.&quot; Most of the interviewees admitted that the education they received since childhood was to &quot;be a good child&quot;, and they have become more and more obedient as their parents wanted. But as they grow up, they gradually lose their edges and individuality, lack self-confidence, and lose the ability to question and imagine. German psychologist Heicha once followed and observed 100 children who dared to question authority and 100 well-behaved and obedient children. Ultimately, it was found that 84% of the former were strong-willed and had the ability to independently analyze, judge things and make decisions when they grew up; while most of the latter became submissive and fearful of taking responsibility. Zhang Tongdao, director of the documentary &quot;Post Zero&quot;, said: &quot;There are no two identical leaves in this world. Respecting the individuality of each child is the starting point of education.&quot; A child whose personality has been smoothed out is destined to become more mediocre as he lives. Because edges and corners are often where a person’s brilliance lies. There is only talent education but no personality education. In the popular drama &quot;The Hidden Corner&quot;, Zhu Chaoyang is a recognized academic master. He ranks first in the grade every year, but he cannot get along with his classmates because of his dull personality. The head teacher came to his mother to discuss the matter, but his mother said: &quot;Students should focus on studying. Making friends is something you do when you enter society. Just study well and everything else is not important.&quot; In daily life, The topics she communicated with her son were limited to homework and scores. It was precisely because of the mother&#39;s neglect of her son&#39;s character development that Chaoyang embarked on the path of darkness step by step, and eventually became a cold, dark, and lying little devil. Li Meijin, an expert in educational psychology, has emphasized more than once: Children’s character development is more important than intellectual education. The ultimate goal of education is not that everyone becomes a talent, but that everyone becomes an adult. As Professor Yi Zhongtian said: &quot;My slogan is, I hope my children will grow up. What kind of person? A real person. Is there a standard? Yes, eight words: first truth, second kindness, third health, fourth happiness.&quot; Only There is no quality education in exam-oriented education. After this year’s college entrance examination results were released, one comment left a deep impression on me: “Today’s super academics are no longer stereotyped nerds, but are sunny, confident, cheerful, courageous, dreamy, and dare to All-round talents who challenge and reject mediocrity and give full play to the color of youth...&quot; Indeed, today&#39;s top academics not only have excellent academic performance, but also all have talents. But if you observe carefully, you will find that the parents of these top academics often have similar educational philosophies: rather than test-taking ability, they care more about whether their children have self-learning ability, hobbies, and a strong heart. Therefore, the parents of Wu Yishu, a talented poet and poet, will cultivate the habit of reading in their daughter from an early age. They will read &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; and then &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; with their daughter; the parents of Meng Linghao, a top student in Shandong 711, will not force him to He attends tutoring classes and fully supports his son’s hobby of playing the cello. As Tang Jiangpeng, vice president of the Chinese Education Society, said: &quot;Without scores, students cannot pass today&#39;s college entrance examination; but with only scores, I am afraid they will not be able to win future major exams.&quot; In the second half of life, what widens the gap between children is not IQ is not a score, but the cultivation of interests, the shaping of habits, the development of mentality... These comprehensive qualities are the core competitiveness of children in the future. There is only elite education but no spiritual education. Former Peking University psychiatrist Xu Kaiwen told a case: There is a child whose parents are bankers and live a wealthy life. He is also in high school in an international school and studies very hard. How hard have you worked? Since I was in junior high school, I have been studying later and later every day, at twelve o&#39;clock, one o&#39;clock, two o&#39;clock... By the second semester of my sophomore year in high school, I had to stay up until three or four o&#39;clock every night. Under the pressure, the child began to harm himself and even had suicidal thoughts. Dr. Xu suggested sending the child to the hospital for treatment, but only two days later, the parents discharged the child. When I asked, my parents said it was time for the final exam. The child also said that he must keep the first place, otherwise there will be nothing. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, the child&#39;s mother called Dr. Xu and said that the child had used the chemistry knowledge she had learned to end his own life. A child is not a learning machine, and the meaning of parents to their children is not just to urge them to become elites. Rather than teaching children to work hard to win, what children need more is someone telling them how to embrace failure. After all, on the road of life, there are times of clear skies and times of wind and rain. Real strength does not mean that you have never experienced the ravages of wind and rain, but that you can withstand it no matter how strong the wind is or how heavy the rain is. Turn the wounds you have suffered into your own unique medals. There is only short-sighted education and no competitive education. At the beginning of this year, &quot;ChatGPT&quot; came out. After talking to experts and conducting research, the media website Insider compiled a list of the types of jobs with the highest risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence technology. Although the span of these occupations is large, they have several obvious common characteristics: they either do not require much creativity and do not need to overthink when operating, or the work content is relatively solid and highly repetitive. This also reminds us that with the development and improvement of artificial intelligence, parents must also adjust their education strategies in a timely manner. If you only focus on the current utility, blindly force your children to answer questions, take exams, or improve their academic performance, and ignore the prediction of future development, your children will completely lose their competitiveness in ten years. Parents love their children and have far-reaching plans. What we should really focus on is not children’s recitation and problem-solving abilities, but those abilities that are scarce in artificial intelligence. For example, higher emotional intelligence, a strong heart, literary and artistic accomplishments, emotional and relationship processing abilities, etc. Education is not for temporary leadership, but a far-sighted investment. By continuing to learn and empower children, they can find opportunities to embrace the future amid tremendous changes. There is only success education but no adult education. Nan Huaijin, a master of Chinese studies, once said a shocking saying: &quot;Don&#39;t think that getting a university diploma or a doctorate is enough to be great. This is not considered success. You must know that the purpose of education is to be a successful person.&quot; We have always emphasized the importance of success to our children. But in fact, if a child does not know how to behave, no matter how capable he is, he will be rejected by others. There is such a story: a child studying in Germany had excellent grades in school, but was repeatedly rejected when looking for a job after graduation. After one interview, he couldn&#39;t bear it anymore and asked the interviewer face to face why he was not hired. The interviewer said frankly: &quot;We highly recognize your work ability, but we checked your credit record and found that you have experienced fare evasion three times. Therefore, we unanimously believe that you do not follow the rules and are not worthy of trust.&quot; From a long life perspective, character is the most decisive quality. No matter how outstanding your achievements are, you will not be able to be entrusted with important tasks if you have bad conduct; no matter how outstanding your abilities are, you will not be able to go far if you don&#39;t know how to behave. If you don’t want to work hard all your life and raise a waste that cannot adapt to society, you must tell your children as early as possible: Talent is very important in this life, but altruistic thinking and a down-to-earth life are more important. There is only utilitarian education but no emotional education. Qian Liqun, a professor at Peking University, once said: In Chinese universities, including the best Peking University and Tsinghua University, there are a group of students in their 20s who are already &quot;sophisticated&quot; students. They are highly intelligent, worldly, sophisticated, good at performing, know how to cooperate, and are better at using the system to achieve their own goals. He called this group of people &quot;refined egoists.&quot; Such children are often the product of utilitarian education. The writer Jiu Ye knew a teacher couple who worked hard to train their son to become an elite. After the son took root in Germany, the couple spent all their savings to help their son buy a house abroad. But when his father was diagnosed with cancer, his son only came back for two days in a hurry, during which time he was still dealing with official duties. Until his father became seriously ill and passed away, his son never came home to see him again. Suddenly one day, the son heard that the house in his hometown was going to be demolished, so he took his wife and daughter back to China and asked his mother for compensation. The old mother, who was completely heartbroken, regretted it endlessly. She had only taught her children to strive for first place, but failed to teach them to love, and ultimately ended up living a miserable life. As the writer Bi Shumin said: &quot;Parents in the world, if you love your children, you must let them start to love you and the people around you from the moment they can. This is by no means selfishness of adults, but the foresight of thinking for the whole life of your children.&quot; Teaching children to express love and give love is more important than letting them strive for first place and go to a prestigious school. With only fraction education and no life education, do you know how to easily raise a child to waste? That is to let the child have a superior status in the family, not letting him do anything, and doing everything for him like a nanny. Educator Suhomlinsky once warned parents: &quot;Don&#39;t protect your children from working, and don&#39;t be afraid that your children&#39;s hands will wear calluses. Let your children know that bread is hard-won. This kind of labor is very important to your children.&quot; It is said to be true joy.&quot; Life is education, and family is school. On weekdays, we can let children clean up their toys by themselves, so that they can learn to arrange space reasonably and be responsible for their belongings; or we can let children go into the kitchen more, so that they can understand the ratio of ingredients and condiments, and train their hands, eyes, and It can also improve the coordination ability of the brain; it can also let children wash clothes and clean the room by themselves, so as to appreciate the hard work and dedication of their parents... It is better to let children understand the meaning of responsibility and independence in the process of sweating. the value of. There is only moral education without rules education. This summer, a tragedy occurred in Shantou, Guangdong: 12-year-old boy Xiao Du went to the beach to play with two friends. One of his companions accidentally fell into the water. Xiao Du, who was eager to save people, stretched out his arms desperately. He took action, trying to grab his companion. However, because his own strength was too weak, he also fell into the sea and was rescued by his companions who fell into the water. Xiao Du disappeared into the vast sea. Similar stories happen every year: In Tongnan District, Chongqing City, 8 children went to the river to play in the water. One child lost his footing and fell into the river. The other 7 children went to rescue them one by one, but they were all drowned by the turbulent river water. Swallowed; in Xiamen, Fujian, several teenagers went to the beach to play together. One of them fell into deep water, and the other two tried to save him. In the end, a rescuer drowned together with the person who fell into the water... There are no ifs in life, but tragedy requires Reflect. For a long time, our education has always been habitual to instill in children the concept of self-sacrifice and selfless sacrifice, and blindly requires children to be kind and brave. But few people tell their children about the rules of life: when you are weak and encounter an emergency, you don’t have to be so &quot;kind&quot;. Do your best to ensure your own safety first, and then call for help from the adults around you or call the police; when facing bad people, , you don&#39;t have to be completely &quot;honest&quot;, you can choose to lie to ensure your personal safety... It is certainly important to cultivate children&#39;s sense of morality, but the rules about life safety must also be instilled in time. I hope you can collect the above nine reflections on Chinese family education and reflect on yourself at any time. Don&#39;t let wrong educational concepts delay your child&#39;s future.

384,"The latest update is here. Sam is negotiating with the board of directors and feels that the possibility of return is relatively high. Key points: -Sam Altman is currently discussing a possible return with the OpenAI board of directors. He especially communicated with Adam D&#39;Angelo (CEO of POE). -One of the options is to establish a transitional board of directors with Sam as director. - OpenAI’s new CEO Emmett Shear revealed to relevant sources that if the board of directors cannot provide sufficient evidence, he will choose to leave his post. The following is a report from Bloomberg: Sam Altman has opened negotiations with the OpenAI board to explore his possible return - the negotiations focus on whether Altman can return as CEO - current CEO Emmett Shear asked the board to provide evidence of Altman&#39;s misconduct. According to people familiar with the matter, Sam Altman, part of OpenAI Board members and the company&#39;s interim CEO have begun talks to consider bringing the ousted CEO back to the artificial intelligence startup he co-founded. The negotiations were between Altman, CEO Emmett Shear and at least one board member, Adam D&#39;Angelo. People familiar with the matter said they chose to remain anonymous because the discussions were private and could end in nothing. The talks also involve some of OpenAI&#39;s investors, many of whom are actively pushing for Altman&#39;s return. A person familiar with the matter said that if Altman does return, he will serve as the company&#39;s CEO. One possibility currently being discussed is that Altman would serve on a transitional board. At the same time, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, former Salesforce Inc. co-CEO Bret Taylor may also serve as a director on the new board of directors. The board&#39;s communication with Altman was an important development because until Monday, directors had largely refused to engage with the executive they fired on Friday, according to several people familiar with the matter. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI shareholders who want Altman to return to his position include Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures and Tiger Global Management. Sequoia Capital, a well-known venture capital firm, is acting in concert with these shareholders, another person familiar with the matter said. On Monday, Anna Makanju, the company&#39;s vice president of global affairs, sent a memo to employees saying the company had been having &quot;intensive discussions&quot; with the board, Altman and Shear to reach consensus. Previously, most employees had threatened to resign en masse if Altman was not reappointed, among other demands. More details: OpenAI leadership tells employees to &#39;move on&#39; amid chaos Addressing the company&#39;s leadership turmoil before Thanksgiving is an urgent priority, a person familiar with the matter said, hoping employees won&#39;t have to worry about themselves during the holiday. job prospects. The decision to fire Altman came under scrutiny from the board, which claimed the CEO was &quot;not always honest&quot; in his communications. Since then, board members and employees have said the CEO&#39;s removal was not related to any &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; or &quot;security issues,&quot; leaving an information void. As the CEO of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s largest investor, Satya Nadella publicly stated that he had not received any explanation on this matter. The view of the Bloomberg think tank is that Sam Altman may return as CEO of OpenAI, which will greatly enhance Microsoft&#39;s strategic position, especially if Microsoft can have a seat on the new board of directors. This may also be an outcome that Microsoft would prefer to see, considering the higher legal risks it may face if it employs the majority of OpenAI employees. Bloomberg think tank believes that the possibility of Microsoft acquiring OpenAI is very small because there are still regulatory challenges. —Analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard Click here to view the research report. According to people familiar with the situation, even current CEO Shear knew nothing about this decision. He told people close to OpenAI that he did not plan to stay on if the board could not clearly communicate to him in writing the specific reasons for firing Altman. As of Friday, the company&#39;s board of directors included Altman, President Greg Brockman, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora Inc. CEO D&#39;Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown University&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, according to people familiar with the matter. After Altman left, Brockman left the company in protest. In negotiations with the board, Altman was represented by Airbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky, while Shear represented D&#39;Angelo and the board, according to people familiar with the situation. Taylor, who served on Twitter&#39;s board of directors before being acquired by Elon Musk, is said to be taking a more neutral role in the mediation. OpenAI declined to comment on these negotiations.

387,"OpenAI&#39;s &quot;Palace Change&quot; in the past two days has triggered a big discussion on &quot;how artificial intelligence should develop&quot;. Should the development of artificial intelligence be restricted and only allowed to become an auxiliary tool for humans? Or should it be allowed to develop? Let it become a human-level existence, or even surpass human beings (it can do everything instead of human beings)? \r\n\r\nThe self-driving car accident that occurred in the United States in October can give us some hints. On October 2, a human-driven car hit a pedestrian in San Francisco, USA. It was not a big deal, and the pedestrian who was hit was not seriously injured. However, after the pedestrian was hit, he fell under a self-driving car; the self-driving car started to park to the right according to the intelligent principle of &quot;pull over after a collision to minimize safety risks&quot;; this caused the pedestrian below to , was dragged 6 meters by the self-driving car, crushed and hit, and his injuries became serious. \r\n\r\nLogically speaking, there is nothing wrong with pulling over after a collision. However, the autonomous driving system did not take into account various special situations (such as this time, there was a person under the wheel), which led to disaster. Of course, you can say that the autonomous driving system is not mature enough yet, and it will be perfect after taking into account various special circumstances. \r\n\r\nHowever, what I want to remind you is: the core of this matter is not that the autonomous driving is not perfect, but that the autonomous driving system can completely reject human intervention and make its own judgments. If autonomous driving is controlled by some bad capital, the people riding on autonomous driving and the city streets where autonomous driving is rampant will become prey for others; if autonomous driving derives autonomous consciousness, it can even oppose AI. Engineers modified it. \r\n\r\nSo, my personal point of view is: the development direction of artificial intelligence must be to &quot;let it become a high-level assistant to human beings&quot;, and it must be left in the artificial intelligence backend port that humans can intervene at any time. Highest authority. \r\n\r\nTo use a sentence from the famous science fiction book &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;: We must give civilization to technology, rather than giving technology to civilization.

389,"From Bloomberg: There are not many details about the interpretation of the future battle of OpenAI, but it talks about the background of the whole thing in general, and specifically mentions China’s investment and work results in AI that are eye-catching. ——Interpretation of the battle for the future of OpenAI - Sam Altman&#39;s sudden dismissal triggered chaos in the startup company - Almost all employees are currently threatening to leave the company OpenAI, as the developer of ChatGPT, fired its co-founder and co-founder last Friday. CEO Sam Altman caused a huge controversy. This shocking news has unsettled investors, partners and employees, and also made this start-up company at the forefront of the world&#39;s artificial intelligence field face severe challenges. Summary of key information: Why is OpenAI so critical? The San Francisco-based company launched ChatGPT a year ago, and the AI chatbot now has 100 million weekly users. The great success of ChatGPT not only triggered a large-scale investment trend in generative AI, but also pushed artificial intelligence into the public eye. OpenAI’s technology has also become the benchmark for many competing AI companies around the world. In the days before Altman&#39;s departure, OpenAI&#39;s valuation reached about $86 billion in an equity transfer that was about to be completed. Now the fate of this equity transfer is in jeopardy. OpenAI&#39;s close relationship with Microsoft Corp., which owns about 49% of OpenAI and is its main provider of computing power, further enhances the startup&#39;s standing in the industry. Affected by the turmoil in OpenAI&#39;s leadership, Microsoft&#39;s stock price has also fluctuated. What’s happening with OpenAI recently? On Friday, OpenAI&#39;s board issued a cryptic statement, saying Altman was fired because he &quot;was not always candid in his communications with the board.&quot; Another co-founder, Greg Brockman, was demoted from the board and quit in protest. The pair tried to negotiate a return to OpenAI on Sunday, with one condition being that existing board members be replaced. Meanwhile, OpenAI&#39;s investors and top executives are pushing for Altman&#39;s reappointment. However, OpenAI&#39;s board of directors eventually appointed Twitch co-founder and former CEO Emmett Shear as the second interim CEO. The previous interim CEO-Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati-supported the return of Altman and Brockman to the company. Later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman and Brockman would lead a new AI research group within the $2.8 trillion software company. After this, almost all OpenAI employees threatened to leave and join Microsoft unless Altman was reappointed and the entire board of directors resigned. What do the two opposing sides pursue? Altman has been a leading figure at OpenAI, transforming the company from a nonprofit into a globally recognized AI research brand. But he and board members disagreed over steps to rapidly develop generative AI, how to commercialize the product and how to reduce potential harm to the public. So far, the board of directors has given no further public explanation for Altman&#39;s departure. For Microsoft, OpenAI is the core of its AI strategy. Nadella showed that whether Altman and his team return to Microsoft or OpenAI, he will be fine with it. The key is to maintain the expertise and research power they had last week. In addition, companies such as Nvidia Corp. and Salesforce Inc. have expressed willingness to hire OpenAI software engineers. After Nvidia&#39;s high-standard accelerator chips, AI talent is the industry&#39;s scarcest resource. Why do some people think OpenAI’s technology may be dangerous? This is in line with widespread concerns about the threats that AI may pose. There are concerns that rapid development of AI without adequate human supervision may produce uncontrolled intelligence. While this theoretical scenario may be some time away, efforts are still underway to understand the full impact that intelligent computers could have, including augmenting or replacing jobs, accurately predicting the future, and simulating human reasoning and conversation. How does the turmoil at OpenAI reflect the broader discussion about AI? While we haven&#39;t yet gotten a full explanation for the board&#39;s firing of Altman, the dispute over the speed of commercialization appears to be the key. This divide is reflected in other areas as well. For example, Google has always advocated a cautious and slow-moving strategy, which made it seem slightly behind OpenAI after it launched ChatGPT and quickly became popular. Although Google has invested more than ten years of research and investment in the field of AI. With labels like “accelerationist” and “safetyist” emerging, lines have been drawn around levels of optimism about AI’s potential benefits and risks. Some accelerationists argue that the United States must act as quickly as possible in order not to be overtaken by China. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also said that China’s investment and work results in AI are impressive. Google’s Pichai thinks China will be at the forefront of AI (1) O web link Why do people want Altman to return to OpenAI? Altman played a key role in raising OpenAI&#39;s profile and securing a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft that provided the company with the technology resources it needed. His experience at the startup accelerator YCombinator and his interactions with the Silicon Valley venture capital circle make him well-suited to lead the company in seeking additional investment and support. The $86 billion equity transfer, led by Thrive Capital, has not been completely canceled, but now appears to depend on Altman&#39;s return and OpenAI returning to its status quo before last week&#39;s changes. What is the future direction of artificial intelligence? This emerging technology is undergoing regulatory scrutiny and assessment globally, with the UK recently organizing an international conference to discuss appropriate strategies for its adoption. Private companies and government agencies are negotiating how to mitigate potential harm without stifling innovation. In China, Beijing has also taken the lead in formulating a series of clear regulations on the use of AI, taking into account the benefits and competitive advantages brought by leadership in the technological field. In terms of the development and application of AI, the current focus of most people is to obtain as much computing power as possible to train large-scale basic models. The next focus will be on model optimization and specialization. Before last week&#39;s chaos, OpenAI was hard at work developing AI &quot;agents&quot; capable of handling more complex tasks, the next critical step in the development of artificial intelligence.

390,"Three major pieces of news came late at night, one of which made investors furious. Will the A-share market change on Wednesday? Just now, three news broke out in the securities market. The sudden bad news in this direction made stock investors very angry. Will Black Wednesday come? Where is the direction? Let me tell you quickly! 1. The other side announced the first R&amp;D investment of US$3 billion in the &quot;Chip Act&quot; to fund the advanced packaging industry. do you know? Currently, the other side&#39;s chip packaging capacity accounts for only 3% of the world&#39;s total, while our estimate is as high as 38%. Advanced packaging is not a new thing, and the industry chain is relatively mature. It is just because of the demand for AI that everyone is paying attention again! In order to maintain its advantage, the other side needs to invest US$3 billion to fund the advanced packaging industry. Obviously, they want to seize more market share. In addition, there is news that South Korea and the United Kingdom are going to sign a semiconductor cooperation agreement. There is no doubt about the direction of the spearhead, which makes people angry and helpless. Although many places interpreted this news tonight as good for autonomy and control, but when the competitiveness is not as good as others and others are taking away jobs, I understand that it is undoubtedly a bad news. What do you think? The result will depend on whether the advanced packaging and testing on Wednesday and the concept of small chips will plummet on Wednesday. 2. Securities firms are required to have an account opening rate of 80% on the Beijing Stock Exchange? It can be said that the small tickets of the Beijing Stock Exchange have been speculated in the past two days. From the perspective of hindsight: there is also the impact of the North Exchange&#39;s inclusion in the China Securities Index in December and the imminent lifting of the ban on many two-year closed period funds of the North Exchange. In addition, there are two rumors. One is that the main board IPO has become stricter, which means that more companies are going to be listed on the Beijing Stock Exchange, and the market must be enlivened; the other is that the threshold of 500,000 may be lowered! In short, retail investors are always the party with asymmetric information. If they know that the price has risen by nearly 70%, will they take the order? 3. Computing power has become the core productivity of the digital economy. Huawei is boasting about its computing power again. In addition to the previous two times, this is already the third time! This shows the importance of computing power in the future development of science and technology, and it is a battleground for enterprises. In the era of digital economy, computing power is a new type of productivity and plays an increasingly important role in promoting technological progress, empowering the digital transformation of industries, and promoting economic and social development. In addition, data elements, another important branch of the digital economy, are also beneficial; Guangdong: Support the Guangzhou and Shenzhen Data Exchanges in establishing national-level data exchanges. These two pieces are worth paying attention to. Looking back at the index, I reminded both before and during the market that when the index was weak for a long time, the first two rebounds to near the 60-day line were prone to adjustments. Therefore, in the morning, we took profit stops on the dark horses in our work. Four companies, one with 7% and two with 4%, made pretty good profits. This is experience. There are not many reasons. Even if the market looks good in the morning, it is expected that there will be two days of shocks, and the risk will not be great. On the contrary, high-quality sectors will take advantage of this adjustment and have a good opportunity to buy at low prices. Chance.

391,"The stock price hits a new high, is Microsoft a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot;, and will it eliminate the troubles of AI in one fell swoop? Although the OpenAI court battle has not yet ended, looking back at Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&#39;s actions over the past two days, he is indeed known as the master of market value management. Last Friday, the OpenAI board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman without warning, and President Brockman announced his resignation in protest. After the crisis broke out unexpectedly, Microsoft was actually confused. Nadella himself only received the news a few minutes before the dismissal announcement was issued. After Microsoft immediately issued a bland statement indicating that it would continue to cooperate with OpneAI, Microsoft&#39;s market value evaporated by nearly 2% last Friday, almost losing one JD.com. Throughout the weekend, investors around the world were focusing on how OpenAI’s court battle would end, and Nadella’s actions could be said to turn the tide—she recruited Sam Altman and Greg Brockman before the start of the U.S. stock market’s night trading, without letting them go out to set up a new business, nor did they Let them be poached by competitors like Google. Microsoft finally closed up 2% on Monday, completely recovering the losses caused by the palace dispute and hitting a record high. The stock price continued to rise after the market closed. Looking back at the entire incident, Microsoft is definitely a blessing in disguise, and Nadella has demonstrated his extraordinary ability to protect shareholder value. Now 95% of OpenAI employees have signed a joint letter threatening to join Microsoft, and Nadella has almost acquired OpenAI at a very small cost. In the words of analyst Ben Thompson, &quot;There is no risk of antitrust litigation.&quot; But what is more important for Microsoft right now is to completely eradicate future troubles. The follow-up direction of Gong Dou is uncertain. Altman may still return to Microsoft and is determined to &quot;eliminate future troubles.&quot; On Monday, local time, Nadella said in a media interview that OpenAI&#39;s key artificial intelligence research is still continuing, and the partnership with Microsoft is also continuing. OpenAI employees can choose to stay in their current positions or switch to Microsoft. He is &quot;open to both options&quot; and stressed that Microsoft will prepare &quot;the conditions for continued independent innovation&quot; for its upcoming new colleagues. However, his statements in the interview also hinted that Altman&#39;s final whereabouts may still be unclear. If the board member who initiated the coup resigns and OpenAI&#39;s management structure is reorganized, Altman still seems to be expected to return. Microsoft&#39;s abacus is very obvious: Either all OpenAI employees will be merged into Microsoft and become Microsoft&#39;s inhouseAI department, or the governance structure will be reorganized to prevent similar things from happening in the future. But no matter which outcome, Microsoft is the winner - considering that OpenAI still needs Microsoft&#39;s financial support and computing backbone to develop its technology, it is also a good thing for Microsoft to let Altman return to OpenAI under a different organizational structure. OpenAI&#39;s major investors, including Microsoft, Tiger Global, Thrive Capital, and Sequoia, tried to overturn the decision of the OpenAI board of directors over the weekend and let the expelled Altman return to the helm, but the negotiations ultimately failed. &quot;I think it&#39;s very clear that there have to be some changes around governance,&quot; Nadella stressed in Monday&#39;s interview, adding that Microsoft &quot;will have a friendly conversation with OpenAI&#39;s board about this.&quot; In addition, Nadella also said that Microsoft respects OpenAI’s non-profit roots and shares its beliefs about AI safety: “We want to make sure that from day one, we are not only dealing with the benefits of technology, but also the risks that technology brings. Unintended consequences, rather than waiting for things to happen before dealing with them.&quot; The palace fight incident also exposed Microsoft&#39;s weaknesses. Although the situation was effectively controlled, it must be emphasized that the occurrence of this palace fight farce has highlighted the seriousness of the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship. instability. As the world&#39;s second largest company by market value, Microsoft&#39;s investment of more than $13 billion in OpenAI did not buy enough influence. Microsoft has no board seat and no control over OpenAI. Although it continues to launch profitable products and services, OpenAI is still a non-profit organization in terms of organizational structure. Three independent directors who have nothing to do with the company&#39;s interests control more than half of the seats. NewStreetResearch analysts wrote in a report on Sunday: &quot;Because OpenAI&#39;s board of directors controls both non-profit and for-profit entities, it controls its cooperation with Microsoft and therefore controls Microsoft&#39;s future.&quot; Since January this year Since the additional investment in OpenAI, Microsoft&#39;s market value has increased by nearly one trillion US dollars during this period, far ahead among technology giants. This technology giant, which missed the mobile transformation, is not lagging behind in the competition of emerging technologies for the first time in more than two decades. According to Wall Street analysts&#39; expectations, although revenue has approached US$300 billion, AI will still create significant new growth space, and Microsoft&#39;s revenue is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 14% in the next three years. Microsoft needs an OpenAI with more stable management, or it can cultivate its own inhouseAI department by absorbing OpenAI talents. Nadella must let Microsoft&#39;s big customers know that Microsoft&#39;s important code and competitive advantages will not be disrupted by Silicon Valley soap operas. The dramatic reversal and reversal of the OpenAI palace fight has reached a jaw-dropping level. Yesterday, the OpenAI board of directors withstood the tremendous pressure from investors and employees and hired someone from outside the company to take over the CEO position. Negotiations for the return of former CEO Sam Altman and former president Greg Brockman, who were fired by the board of directors, have completely broken down. At the same time, Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest funder, announced that Altman and Brockman will join Microsoft to lead the AI department. But the matter was not over yet. OpenAI employees who learned that their old leader would not return began to write a joint letter threatening that if Sam Altman and Greg Brockman could not return to OpenAI, they would also resign and join Microsoft. As of press time, according to the latest statistics from X netizens, 734 of OpenAI&#39;s more than 770 employees have signed a joint letter, and the entire OpenAI can basically be disbanded on the spot. The most outrageous thing is that the chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who was previously regarded as the &quot;coup mastermind&quot;, also signed the joint letter and tweeted to express his regret for participating in the coup, which means that he has completely shifted to the Altman camp.

393,"[The No. 1 Artificial Intelligence Team | Minsheng Computer] 🚀OpenAI’s annual drama has settled: How do you see SAM joining Microsoft? Event: On November 20, 2023, former OpenAI CEO SAM and former president Greg joined Microsoft. Microsoft promised to form a new advanced AI research team and provide maximum resource support. According to IT House and Theinformation, including GPT4 research director jakub Dozens of OpenAI employees, including Aleksander, AI risk director, and Sidor, open source director, may announce their resignation. History has actually told us, will Sam and the core team bring Microsoft the world&#39;s top large-model technology and products besides OpenAI? In 2021, OpenAI&#39;s GPT3 core R&amp;D staff also left their jobs due to differences in ideas to found Anthropic. Its Claude2 large model is one of the few large models in the world that can rival GPT4. In October 2023, Anthropic received an investment of US$6 billion from rival giants such as Google and Amazon, with a valuation of US$20 billion. Technology belongs to technology, and business belongs to business. It’s a blessing in disguise, but it’s a blessing in disguise. Artificial intelligence with GPT5 capabilities or above is so powerful that, in Kissinger’s recent words, it is comparable to the nuclear deterrence of our era. Forced balance may be safer than a dominant player. For Microsoft, it completes the AI empire and AI applications. Commercialization is expected to accelerate. Microsoft Research (Microsoft Research), which SAM and others joined, has long been committed to developing and commercializing cutting-edge technologies. For example, Microsoft Research currently has 28,946 papers, 342 of which are related to Bing. It continues to contribute new technologies to empower Bing, such as &quot;Model Ensemble for Click Prediction in Bing Search Ads&quot; 》The CTR technology proposed can effectively improve the efficiency of Bing advertising. Based on the Microsoft CEO&#39;s clear commitment to give SAM maximum resources, we believe that Microsoft&#39;s cloud computing, application scenarios, and just-released AI chips have provided a broad space for SAM and his original OpenAI large model team to play. Microsoft With top-notch large models that can be used freely, the commercialization of AI applications is expected to accelerate unprecedentedly. For the AI industry, the time has come for all the heroes to join forces, and the future will be even more exciting. 1) The cooperation between OpenAI and Microsoft is still in progress, and OpenAI may accelerate the release of new results in exchange for Microsoft&#39;s continued investment; 2) Google/Anthropic, the two major OpenAI pursuers, may Seize the window period and launch bottom-of-the-box products to replace OpenAI and become the global AI ecosystem leader (you can pay attention to whether Google Gemini and Anthropic&#39;s ClaudePro will release an application ecosystem similar to GPTs); 3) After the powerful alliance between Microsoft and SAM, Microsoft has already To establish a full-scenario AI ecosystem from chip to cloud to edge, other leaders in the AI field such as NVIDIA and AMD in the chip field, Amazon in the cloud computing field, etc. may be more urgent to improve their own ecological risk warning: the implementation of technology is not as expected, and the development of large models is not as expected. .

394,"Summary of the big news in the evening. On the ETF options delivery day tomorrow, the pressure on Big A will increase dramatically. Is there a big plunge tomorrow? ! $130 million! The United States icon announced that the first R&amp;D investment in the &quot;Chip Act&quot; targets the advanced packaging industry. The U.S. chip and semiconductor sector has continued to rise, but the domestic chip and semiconductor sector has continued to decline. 2. Guangdong icon: Support Guangzhou icon and Shenzhen icon in promoting the construction of the national new generation artificial intelligence innovation and development pilot zone and the national artificial intelligence innovation application pilot zone. Good for artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is diving today, but under this positive expectation, there may be a possibility of a reversal tomorrow. 3. The regulatory authorities have drawn up a &quot;white list&quot; of 50 real estate companies that may be included in the risk-related real estate companies. Great profit! Real estate is expected to surge higher tomorrow, but remember not to chase higher prices! 4. The property market in first-tier cities is loosening again! Guangzhou official announcement: &quot;Abolition of land price cap.&quot; Good for real estate. 5. Tongcheng Travel icon’s revenue in the third quarter reached 3.3 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 61.1%. 6. Kuaishou: Third-quarter revenue increased by 20.8% year-on-year, with a net profit of 3.17 billion, turning a loss into a profit year-on-year! 7. Baidu icon: Net profit increased by 23% year-on-year in the third quarter. 8. NVIDIA icon is about to launch the third computing chip H20 in our domestic market. We should still speed up the process of domestic substitution. What Nvidia can provide us is a simple version. If we still use it, our technology will always be suppressed. Summary: Tomorrow&#39;s ETF options delivery day will be more conservative emotionally. The overlay index has shown signs of inability to rebound, and there is expected to be a risk of a sharp plunge tomorrow. But big A is often against human nature, so if there is a dive tomorrow, a deep V may appear instead. If real estate prices rise and fall tomorrow, the Shanghai Composite Index will plunge. Artificial intelligence, big data, chips, semiconductors, and industrial motherboards continue to be a focus, and positions will continue to be covered at any time.

395,"Reflecting on the recent OpenAI battle, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya kicked Ultraman out of the game. What Musk said is very accurate. Ilya must have seen something to be so radical. And this is most likely about the security of artificial intelligence. Today, the rapid progress of human science and technology has far exceeded the original imagination of mankind. So far, humans have conquered the lowest standard of artificial intelligence - ANI - in many aspects, and it is everywhere. The artificial intelligence revolution is a road from weak artificial intelligence (ANI), to artificial general intelligence (AGI), and then to super artificial intelligence (ASI). Where will mankind go on this road? Will humans be killed by their own inventions? Not to mention the risk of powerful artificial intelligence being mastered by human extremists and used to eliminate dissidents, perhaps humans feel that this aspect is controllable. What if artificial intelligence becomes too powerful for humans to control and becomes enemies of humans? For artificial intelligence to be friendly artificial intelligence, it must be neither hostile to humans nor indifferent to humans. We need to design the core code of artificial intelligence so that it has a deep understanding of human values. The development of artificial intelligence needs to be similar to the development of cloning technology. Is it time to set rules?

401,"Zhong Zhengsheng: Can the &quot;re-industrialization&quot; of the United States break through under the Biden era? Author: Zhong Zhengsheng, Fan Chengkai (Zhong Zhengsheng is a director of the China Chief Economist Forum and chief economist of Ping An Securities) Core Points Biden’s “re-industrialization” is beginning to show results. Since 2021, the Biden administration has sounded the clarion call for &quot;Reindustrialization 3.0&quot; and launched the largest public investment plan since Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal, focusing on the &quot;American Rescue Plan&quot; (ARP) and the &quot;Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act&quot; ( IIJA), the Chip and Science Act (CHIPS) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Investment plans related to the &quot;re-industrialization&quot; theme total approximately US$1.2 trillion, which are planned to be invested in the next 5-10 years, with the peak expenditure likely to be in 2024-2027. How to understand Biden’s vision of “reindustrialization”? First, Biden&#39;s &quot;re-industrialization&quot; inherits the goals of the Obama era and has become a consensus between the two parties now; second, the impact of the new crown has strengthened the Biden administration&#39;s focus on infrastructure and industrial chain security; finally, in the context of the game between great powers, There is greater urgency for the United States to revive its manufacturing industry. So far, the initial results of Biden&#39;s &quot;re-industrialization&quot; are as follows: 1) manufacturing employment has recovered rapidly and exceeded the pre-COVID-19 level; 2) demand for goods has driven a recovery in the proportion of manufacturing added value in GDP, and the economic structure has been optimized; 3) Non-residential construction investment has increased significantly, mainly driven by the infrastructure field and the computer, electronics and electrical industries; 4) Capital expenditures (CAPEX) of U.S. listed companies have increased significantly; 5) FDI inflows into the U.S. manufacturing industry have accelerated, etc. New opportunities for America’s “reindustrialization.” The U.S. has made limited progress in revitalizing its manufacturing industry over the past decade due to a variety of reasons - declining consumer demand for goods relative to services, lack of coherence in industrial policy, labor cost disadvantages, and the negative impact of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. In comparison, we believe that under the Biden era, the probability of successful &quot;re-industrialization&quot; in the United States is higher: 1) The current U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing investment cycle coincides with an upswing, which may strengthen the effect of reindustrialization policies. 2) The development of high-end manufacturing may help break the bottleneck of commodity demand. From 2021 to 2022, the proportion of U.S. consumption of goods, especially durable goods, will increase significantly. In the future, the demand for high-end manufacturing such as new energy vehicles and semiconductors in the United States and around the world will grow significantly. 3) The Biden administration’s “place-based” industrial policy is groundbreaking or more scientific. In addition, the Biden administration has shown greater boldness in implementing large-scale fiscal policies and vigorous industrial policies. 4) The quality of the American labor force is more advantageous in high-end manufacturing competition. This is partly due to the accumulation of relevant talents since the Obama era. 5) The comprehensive cost of the U.S. manufacturing industry may be more advantageous after taking into account economic security considerations (especially energy security, industrial chain risks, etc.). Challenges inherent in America’s “reindustrialization.” First, in the context of automation and artificial intelligence, it may be difficult to develop high-end manufacturing to save the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States. Second, the United States’ “reindustrialization” policy may still be subject to the U.S. political system. If the Democratic Party loses the upcoming 2024 election, Biden&#39;s industrial policies may not be implemented. Third, manufacturing competition from non-U.S. regions is still intensifying. The comprehensive strength of China&#39;s manufacturing industry continues to rise, developed economies such as the European Union are also promoting &quot;re-industrialization&quot;, and other emerging economies besides China may also join the competition. Fourth, a strong dollar may continue to weaken U.S. manufacturing exports.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of Comrade Mao Zedong’s instructions to study and promote the “Maple Bridge Experience” and the 20th anniversary of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s instructions to uphold and develop the “Maple Bridge Experience”. When General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Fengqiao Town, the birthplace of the “Maple Bridge Experience” on September 20, he pointed out, “We must uphold and develop the Maple Bridge Experience in the new era, adhere to the party’s mass line, and correctly handle contradictions among the people. Rely closely on the people, solve problems at the grassroots level and nip them in the bud.&quot; This important speech established an action guide for upholding and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era. 1. Deeply understand the connotation of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era. General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s important speech during his inspection in Fengqiao Town, Zhejiang, comprehensively elaborated on adhering to and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era from the perspective of historical materialism and materialist dialectics. experience” core tenor. &quot;Adhere to the party&#39;s mass line.&quot; The mass line is the lifeline and fundamental work line of the party. In order to correctly handle contradictions among the people, the party relied on cadres and the masses to create the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; and promoted it nationwide. This is the party&#39;s affirmation and sublimation of the masses&#39; initiative, and ultimately &quot;turns the party&#39;s correct ideas into the conscious actions of the masses.&quot; . The &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; follows the cognitive rule of &quot;from practice, to practice&quot;, gives full play to the masses&#39; acumen in identifying contradictions and their initiative in resolving conflicts, and reflects the high degree of unity between the party&#39;s leadership position and the masses&#39; dominant position in social governance. . &quot;Correctly handle contradictions among the people.&quot; From its creation to promotion, from continuous development to continuous sublimation, the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; reflects the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that &quot;the correct handling of contradictions among the people&quot; requires distinguishing between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. &quot;Conflicts among the people are non-antagonistic contradictions&quot; and must be resolved by the method of &quot;unity-criticism-unity&quot;. The &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; adheres to the people-centered stance, the idea of valuing peace, and the method of persuasion and education, ensuring the correct direction of promoting harmony, stability, and development when dealing with conflicts among the people. &quot;Rely closely on the people.&quot; The people are the producers of material wealth, the creators of spiritual wealth and the decisive force for social change. In the 1960s, Fengqiao innovated methods in the socialist education movement, insisting on arresting fewer people, not turning over conflicts, and relying on the masses to reform the &quot;four types of elements&quot; on the spot; in the 1980s, in order to combat criminal crimes, various localities implemented integrated Comprehensive social security management that integrates combat, prevention, education, and management; in the new era, widely established grassroots governance organizations and conflict resolution centers all have the masses as the important subjects and those responsible for resolving conflicts. The &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; fully embodies the working principle of &quot;closely relying on the people&quot; to prevent, mediate and resolve social conflicts and disputes. &quot;Solve problems at the grassroots level.&quot; The grassroots level is the cell of society and the basis for building a harmonious society. If the foundation is not strong, the ground will shake. It can be said that the grassroots level is not only the &quot;source&quot; of interest conflicts and social contradictions, but also the &quot;stubble&quot; for coordinating interest relationships and easing social contradictions. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China positioned the working field of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era at the grassroots level of society, and regarded the resolution of contradictions and conflicts at the grassroots level as an important working mechanism. &quot;Nip problems in the bud.&quot; The process from the emergence to the disintegration of conflicts is divided into four stages: non-confrontation, balance, confrontation, and intensification. &quot;Resolving conflicts in the bud&quot; means proactively analyzing risk points based on the logic of conflict evolution, intervening in the conflict process in advance, preventing the disorderly evolution of conflicts, and resolving conflicts in a non-confrontational or balanced stage. In the 1990s, Fengqiao cadres and the masses established the &quot;Four Front Work Method&quot;, that is, organization construction precedes work, prediction work precedes prevention, prevention work precedes mediation, and mediation precedes intensification; at the beginning of the 21st century, The development is &quot;four in advance and four early&quot;, that is, early warning is in advance, and the emerging problems are digested early; education is in advance, key objects are transformed early; control is in advance, and sensitive periods are prevented early; mediation is in advance, and conflicts and disputes are handled early, all based on contradictions. An initiative to establish work goals in stages. 2. Correctly understand the new situations and new issues facing grassroots governance. On March 1, 2013, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in his important speech at the 80th anniversary conference and opening ceremony of the Central Party School that “an important issue facing the whole party , is how to correctly understand and properly handle the new situations and new problems that continue to arise after our country develops.&quot; Correctly understanding the new situations and new problems that are constantly emerging is the premise and foundation for adhering to and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era. The subject of the conflict changes. The first is the change in the proportion of urban and rural population. Calculated in terms of permanent population, in 1963 when the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; was formed, my country&#39;s urbanization rate was 16.84%; in 1978, at the beginning of reform and opening up, my country&#39;s urbanization rate was 17.92%; in 2022, it climbed to 65.22%. As a large number of people gather in cities, rural residents decrease sharply, and the countryside becomes &quot;hollowed out.&quot; Second, the composition of the urban and rural population is becoming increasingly complex. In the past, the identities of my country&#39;s social population were relatively single, mostly workers, farmers, cadres, etc. Currently, from a statistical perspective alone, it can be divided into 8 major categories and more than 1,800 subcategories. Third, personnel mobility has increased dramatically. With the rapid development of information, transportation, logistics, etc., the household registration system has gradually weakened, the phenomenon of &quot;separation of people and households&quot; has become more common, and the &quot;society of acquaintances&quot; has gradually turned into a &quot;society of strangers&quot;. Conflicts of ideas occur from time to time, and management vacancies inevitably occur. The realization of &quot;small things do not leave the village and big things do not leave the town&quot; faces many new situations and new challenges. The contradictory objects have been adjusted. At present, the main contradiction in our society has been transformed into the contradiction between the people&#39;s growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. A better life requires not only higher demands on material and cultural life, but also increasing demands on democracy, rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and the environment. The main manifestations are the increase in the number of contradictions, the diversity of types of contradictions, and the diversity of contradictory demands. In addition to traditional marriage, family, and property disputes, the proportion of economic and labor disputes has increased, real estate expropriation and NIMBY incidents occur from time to time, and production safety and urban safety issues are prominent. People no longer stop at general mediation and resolution of conflicts, but increasingly have diverse demands such as information disclosure, agile governance, administrative response, procedural fairness, and public participation. The contradictory environment undergoes changes. First, changes in the economic development environment. In the 1960s, Fengqiao Town, Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province created the &quot;Fengqiao Experience&quot; in the socialist education movement. Compared with 60 years ago, today&#39;s economic and social development has undergone tremendous changes, and new contradictions such as economic disputes, ecological and environmental protection disputes, and Internet disputes are constantly emerging. How to adhere to and develop the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era while constantly innovating has become a problem for all regions. New issues faced by various departments. The second is the change in the interpersonal communication environment. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that if we cannot pass the Internet, we will not be able to pass the long-term rule. The development of the Internet has changed the way people communicate or interact, and the combination of online and offline has brought about changes in governance. Currently, the number of online petitions nationwide accounts for more than 70% of the total number of petitions. At the same time, the Internet is prone to the &quot;information cocoon&quot; effect, forming new conflict fields, leading to the emergence of problems such as the solidification of prejudices, information distortion, superposition of contradictions, and intensification of conflicts. The third is changes in the institutional environment. There are 298 effective laws and more than 600 administrative regulations in my country. There are a large number of local laws and regulations, and various technical standards and normative documents are also very complete. Compared with 60 years ago, grassroots governance is more &quot;law-based&quot;, but it also puts forward higher requirements for specific work. How to develop well in the new era within a more detailed institutional framework and on the premise of legality and compliance? &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; has become a new situation faced by grassroots governance. 3. Coordinate and handle several dialectical relationships, and improve grassroots governance with the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot;. Upholding and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era is of great significance to us in promoting Chinese-style modernization and continuously improving the grassroots governance system and modernization of governance capabilities. , in specific practical work, we must focus on handling the following dialectical relationships. We must properly handle the dialectical relationship between upholding the party&#39;s leadership and stimulating the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses. To uphold and develop the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era, we must adhere to the party&#39;s mass line, promote party building to lead grassroots governance, strengthen the construction of grassroots party organizations, and strengthen the work of party members and leading cadres in visiting, sinking, and receiving visits. Strengthen the party&#39;s administrative supervision of the government in accordance with the law, carry out work to cultivate social rational space, and establish an all-round coordination mechanism for conflict mediation and handling of emergencies. At the same time, we should give full play to the advantages of grassroots diversified governance and build a social governance community. In terms of governance foundation, we will further improve the grassroots governance platform with grid management, refined services, and information support; in terms of governance methods, we will build multiple effective mechanisms that combine autonomy, rule of law, rule of morality, and intelligent governance. Handle the dialectical relationship between the universality and particularity of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era. In the new era, the &quot;Fengqiao experience&quot; has surpassed the &quot;Fengqiao Town experience&quot; and the &quot;social security experience&quot;, rising from &quot;one place strategy&quot; to &quot;one country strategy&quot; and from &quot;safe Zhejiang&quot; to &quot;safe Zhejiang&quot;. &quot;Safe China&quot;, uphold and develop the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era, we must not only adhere to the universality, firmly grasp the core connotation, outstanding characteristics, fundamental characteristics, distinctive characteristics and other essentials, but also combine the particularity and strive to achieve It has highlights, characteristics, innovation and vitality. For example, the “Three Zeros” work method of Mudan Community in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, the “Fengqiao Hometown of Overseas Chinese” dispute resolution method in Mingxi County, Fujian Province, the “trust system” dispute resolution work method of Wuhou District, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, Nanjing Maritime Court, etc. 11 The practical exploration of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience on the Sea&quot; by domestic units, and the cross-regional conflict and dispute mediation in Haidong City, Qinghai to serve the &quot;ramen economy&quot;. These innovative practices not only adhere to the universality of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot;, but are also based on regions and industries. The particularity is the persistence and development of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot;, which helps to &quot;guarantee a new development pattern with a new security pattern&quot; and ensure stable economic development and long-term social stability. We must properly handle the dialectical relationship between governance according to law and comprehensive policy implementation. The &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era should be good at using legal thinking and legal methods to resolve conflicts and problems involving the vital interests of the masses. In terms of establishing rules, we maintain the expression of mass demands, coordination of interests, and protection of rights and interests, and protect the interests of new social groups; in terms of rule enforcement, we increase efforts to use conflict guidance, guidance, mediation, arbitration, etc.; in terms of supervision and inspection, Improve procuratorial suggestions, judicial suggestions, supervision suggestions, traceability management and other preventive measures. At the same time, comprehensive policies should be implemented. The most important achievement and the most distinctive feature of the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; that has developed to this day is the realization of the unity of self-discipline and heterodiscipline, rigidity and flexibility, body and mind management, human power and technology. We should be good at using a variety of effective governance methods and tools, clarify the boundaries of mass autonomy, improve the rules and procedures of procedures, carry forward the excellent traditional Chinese culture of &quot;honesty and amity, benevolence and good neighbors&quot;, and highlight the demonstration and demonstration of morality in grassroots social governance. Educational role, giving full play to the supporting role of technical means, and truly realizing the integration of the four governance of &quot;autonomy, rule of law, rule of morality, and rule of intelligence&quot;. Handle the dialectical relationship between emergency response and normal management in preventing and resolving conflicts. &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; is constantly being given new functions, but maintaining long-term social stability has always been its important goal. To uphold and develop the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era, we must accurately grasp the evolution laws of conflicts, strengthen prevention awareness, move the gateway forward, control the conflict situation as soon as possible, and do a good job in emergency response. At the same time, we will strengthen normal risk management and resilience governance. Daily communication with the masses should be strengthened, channels for the masses to express their demands should be opened up, social conditions and public opinion should be regularly assessed, and an &quot;emergency first responder&quot; system should be established to understand even the smallest details. We should be good at giving full play to the technical support role of the network and artificial intelligence, strengthen the construction of monitoring and early warning platforms and mechanisms, strengthen risk analysis and assessment, so that &quot;the platform can run more and the people run less&quot;, and nip problems in their bud. Handle the dialectical relationship between online cyberspace and offline real space. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, “Party and government organs and leading cadres at all levels must learn to follow the mass line through the Internet, frequently browse the Internet, dive, chat, and speak out, understand the people’s thoughts and wishes, collect good ideas and suggestions, and actively Respond to netizens’ concerns and resolve doubts.” The online &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; that has been innovatively formed in some places to &quot;handle matters online, resolve disputes, ensure safety and development, and always provide services online&quot; has given full play to the advantages of the Internet in collecting public opinion, leveraging people&#39;s wisdom, intelligent monitoring, and automatic early warning. and functions, which is a positive form of &quot;taking the online mass line well&quot;. In the new era, we should actively and orderly guide the construction of channels for the Internet to participate in and discuss politics, give full play to the social governance functions of &quot;city message boards&quot;, &quot;public sentiments online&quot; and various &quot;two micro and one terminal&quot; platforms, and mobilize people&#39;s enthusiasm to participate in social governance through the Internet. Strengthen the integration of online and offline work to improve online conflict resolution and network security governance capabilities.

406,"Analysis and prediction of several major A-share sectors tomorrow: 1-Securities: Although it rose and fell back today, closing slightly lower, according to my observation, this should be the main force testing the market, and it will rise again tomorrow, or close the positive line. 2-Bank: A new round of rise has begun. The long upper shadow line closed today is an obvious fairy-guiding K-line. It will fluctuate higher tomorrow and may close sharply. 3-Liquor: A new round of rise is on the way, and it will continue to rise tomorrow. It will fall back after a high or close the positive line. 4-New Energy: Although it opened higher and fluctuated lower today and closed slightly lower, this is a very normal trend in the early stage of a rising market. Tomorrow, it will rise and rise after a narrow range of fluctuations, and then fall back or close with a small positive line. 5-Semiconductor: It opened low and fluctuated lower today, and closed sharply. According to my observation, short-term adjustments are basically in place. Tomorrow it will dip slightly and then rise to start a new round of rise, or it may close with a big positive line. 6-Artificial Intelligence: The recent gains have been too great, and the short-term adjustment has not ended. It will continue to fall tomorrow, and may close sharply. 7-Real estate: Affected by external favorable factors, it opened higher and fluctuated higher today. It is obvious that a new round of rise has arrived.

408,"OpenAI&#39;s &quot;Palace Changes&quot; in the past two days have triggered a big discussion on &quot;how artificial intelligence should develop&quot;. Should the development of artificial intelligence be restricted and only allowed to become an auxiliary tool for humans? Or should it be allowed to develop? Let it become a human-level existence, or even surpass human beings (it can do everything instead of human beings)? The self-driving car accident that occurred in the United States in October can give us some hints. On October 2, a human-driven car hit a pedestrian in San Francisco, USA. It was not a big deal, and the pedestrian who was hit was not seriously injured. However, after the pedestrian was hit, he fell under a self-driving car; the self-driving car started to park to the right according to the intelligent principle of &quot;pull over after a collision to minimize safety risks&quot;; this caused the pedestrian below to , was dragged 6 meters by the self-driving car, crushed and hit, and his injuries became serious. Logically speaking, there is nothing wrong with pulling over after a collision. However, the autonomous driving system did not take into account various special situations (such as this time, there was a person under the wheel), which led to disaster. Of course, you can say that the autonomous driving system is not mature enough yet, and it will be perfect after taking into account various special circumstances. However, what I want to remind you is: the core of this matter is not that the autonomous driving is imperfect, but that the autonomous driving system can completely reject human intervention and make its own judgments. If autonomous driving is controlled by some bad capital, the people riding on autonomous driving and the city streets where autonomous driving is rampant will become prey for others; if autonomous driving derives autonomous consciousness, it can even oppose AI. Engineers modified it. Therefore, my personal point of view is: the development direction of artificial intelligence must be to &quot;let it become a high-level assistant to humans&quot;, and it must leave the highest authority for humans to intervene at any time in the background port of artificial intelligence. To paraphrase a sentence from the famous science fiction book &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;: We must give civilization to technology, rather than technology to civilization.

410,"Something more serious than the shortage of computing power has happened! Will global artificial intelligence chips change? You may have heard that in recent years, the global chip industry has faced an unprecedented crisis. Due to the impact of multiple factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic, trade frictions, and supply chain interruptions, there has been a serious shortage of global chip supply, which has resulted in severe impacts on production and consumption in all walks of life. But what you may not know is that in this chip crisis, the contradiction between supply and demand of one type of chip is more prominent, and that is artificial intelligence chips. Artificial intelligence chips are the core of artificial intelligence technology and the key force leading a new round of technological revolution and industrial change. 1. The competitive landscape of global artificial intelligence chips At present, the competitive landscape of global artificial intelligence chips is mainly composed of several major forces such as the United States, China, Europe and Japan. Among them, the United States is the global leader in artificial intelligence chips. It has many world-renowned artificial intelligence chip companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, and Google, and accounts for the majority of the global artificial intelligence chip market. China is a rising star in the world of artificial intelligence chips. It has many innovative and competitive artificial intelligence chip companies such as Huawei HiSilicon, Cambrian, Horizon, and NavInfo. It is catching up and gradually narrowing the gap with the United States. Europe is the traditional powerhouse in artificial intelligence chips in the world. It has many artificial intelligence chip companies with long history and technology accumulation, such as STMicroelectronics, NXP, and Infineon. However, it is relatively lagging behind in the innovation and application of artificial intelligence chips. in the United States and China. Japan is a potential stock in the world&#39;s artificial intelligence chips. It has many artificial intelligence chip companies with profound knowledge in the chip field, such as Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi. However, it is relatively conservative and lacks motivation in terms of research and development and investment in artificial intelligence chips. 2. Technology Development of Global Artificial Intelligence Chips In terms of the architecture and design of artificial intelligence chips, there are currently two main types. One is general-purpose artificial intelligence chips, such as GPU, CPU, FPGA, etc., which can adapt to a variety of artificial intelligence chips. Intelligent applications, but the performance and efficiency are relatively low; the other is dedicated artificial intelligence chips, such as ASIC, NPU, IPU, etc., which are optimized for specific artificial intelligence applications and have relatively high performance and efficiency. At present, the technological development trend of global artificial intelligence chips is the transformation from general to special, from centralized to distributed, from cloud to edge, from single core to multi-core, from rule-driven to data-driven, from digital Transition to simulation, transition from silicon-based to non-silicon-based, etc. In terms of the manufacturing and process of artificial intelligence chips, there are currently two main ways. One is independent manufacturing, that is, chip companies have their own chip manufacturing capabilities and equipment, such as Intel, Samsung, etc.; the other is OEM manufacturing, that is, Chip companies outsource chip manufacturing to professional chip manufacturers, such as TSMC and SMIC. At present, the development trend of global artificial intelligence chip manufacturing and technology is from independent manufacturing to OEM manufacturing, from 28 nanometers to below 7 nanometers, from 2D to 3D, from CMOS to new materials, etc. 3. Crisis and Opportunities of Global Artificial Intelligence Chips In the context of the global chip crisis, artificial intelligence chip companies should strengthen cooperation and share resources, such as sharing chip design, manufacturing, testing, packaging and other resources, and sharing chip supply chains, Distribution channels, market channels and other resources, sharing chip standards, specifications, certification and other resources, sharing chip knowledge, technology, patents and other resources, sharing chip talents, teams, culture and other resources, etc. Through cooperation, artificial intelligence chip companies can reduce costs, improve efficiency, expand scale, and enhance competitiveness. At the same time, they can also enhance trust, promote communication, establish cooperation, and achieve win-win results. In the context of global chip competition, artificial intelligence chip companies should accelerate innovation and enhance value, such as innovating chip architecture, design, algorithms, materials, processes, etc., improving chip performance, power consumption, size, functions, etc., innovating chips products, services, needs, problems, etc., to enhance the brand, reputation, influence, social responsibility, etc. of the chip. Through innovation, artificial intelligence chip companies can improve quality, increase differentiation, create advantages, and win the market. At the same time, they can also increase revenue, increase profits, create value, and achieve development. In the context of global chip changes, artificial intelligence chip companies should strengthen their layout and seize opportunities. Through layout, artificial intelligence chip companies can seize opportunities, occupy the commanding heights, lead the trend, and shape the future. At the same time, they can also resist risks, resolve crises, respond to challenges, and stay ahead. Conclusion Artificial intelligence chips are the core of artificial intelligence technology and the key force leading a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation. In the context of the global chip crisis, the contradiction between supply and demand of artificial intelligence chips has become more prominent, and the shortage of artificial intelligence chips will exceed that of other types of chips. This will have a profound impact on the global artificial intelligence chip market structure, and will also bring huge opportunities and severe crises to global artificial intelligence chip companies.

420,"User: Why do sonar pulses hurt the ears? Are there protective earmuffs? Artificial Intelligence: Sonar pulses generally refer to short pulses of sound waves sent by sonar systems to detect and locate targets. When this kind of sound wave propagates in water, it can produce quite strong sound energy. If these sonar pulses are strong enough, they can cause damage to the human ear, causing hearing damage or ear discomfort. To prevent sonar pulses from causing damage to the human ear, there are some protective measures that can be taken, one of which is to use earplugs or earmuffs. These devices can reduce the intensity of sound waves entering the ear, reducing the impact on the eardrum and auditory system. Some earplugs designed specifically for water activities or working underwater may be waterproof to provide greater protection. Overall, it is very important to protect your ears from sonar pulses, especially for those who perform activities or work in the water for extended periods of time. Choosing appropriate protective earmuffs and taking necessary precautions according to the specific situation can effectively reduce potential harm to the hearing system. UserThank you! How to avoid conflicts and contradictions caused by sonar pulses? Artificial Intelligence: To avoid similar incidents from happening, here are some measures that may help reduce friendly fire: Communications Coordination: National navies should establish effective communications coordination mechanisms when performing missions in common waters to avoid misunderstandings and increase awareness levels. Timely and clear communication can reduce possible miscalculations. Identification system: Use identification systems, such as ship markings, specific frequency communications, etc., to ensure that the other party can clearly identify it. This can help avoid mistaking friendly targets for potential threats. Adopt international standards and procedures: Adhere to international maritime laws and regulations to ensure the same standards are followed when operating in shared waters. This includes complying with the rules of navigation and contact with other military vessels. Technological innovation: Continuously develop and use advanced technologies, such as more accurate identification and positioning systems, to reduce the risk of friendly fire. Conduct joint training: Conduct joint military exercises and training to improve interoperability and mutual understanding between the militaries of various countries. This helps build trust and reduces the chance of miscalculation. Open Dialogue and Cooperation: Engage in open and honest dialogue through diplomatic channels to resolve underlying issues and seek to establish stable bilateral relations. Overall, tensions caused by friendly fire can be reduced through a combination of technical means, coordination mechanisms, training and diplomatic channels. The international community needs to work together to ensure that peace and security are maintained when operating in common waters. UserThank you! Artificial Intelligence: You’re welcome!

421,"Baidu Shares Will Look for Earnings Boost Chinese tech company Baidu will report earnings on Tuesday and will need a positive performance to resume its bullish stance. Baidu stock has fallen sharply since September and is now close to resistance at the May support level of 116. A break above this level could lead to further upside. For earnings per share, 20 analysts forecast HK$2.30 per share, higher than HK$2.31 in the same period last year. Compared with the previous quarter, sales are expected to increase by 2.96% to HK$36.71 billion. Investors may look past the company&#39;s recent profitability and focus on its progress in artificial intelligence. Robin Li, co-founder and chairman of Lenovo, is looking to open up new revenue streams to gain an edge in generative artificial intelligence. In October this year, when Baidu released its latest artificial intelligence model, Ernie 4.0, it said it was now as good as Silicon Valley rival OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4. However, restrictions from the United States will make it increasingly difficult for Chinese technology companies to obtain chips. This could harm the company&#39;s ability to train AI models. Baidu was said to be part of a consortium of Chinese companies that ordered $5 billion worth of chips in August.

500,"There is a special thing about the Wu case, that is, the doubts are obvious, but everyone chooses to keep silent and stop others from raising questions. For example: On July 22, 2021, Chaoyang police reported that Du Mouzhu was hyping up her relationship in order to increase her online popularity. As a result, on the night of the first-instance verdict, she herself admitted in a live broadcast room that she was the victim in the verdict. --Why? Can&#39;t ask! Asking questions is questioning the police&#39;s ability to handle cases. In July 2021, Du Mouzhu asked Wu Yifan for 8 million yuan on his personal Weibo, and the eight victims spoke out. However, Chaoyang police said in an interview with Xinjing Bao that Du Mouzhu had never contacted Wu Yifan or asked Wu Fang for money. ——Why is there a contradiction? Can&#39;t ask! Asking is to clear Wu Yifan&#39;s name. In July 2021, Chaoyang police reported that Liu was cheating at both ends. Now, two years later, Liu Yuan has been sentenced to 10 years, but his verdict is nowhere to be seen on the Internet. ——Where is the verdict? Can&#39;t ask! To ask is to question the court&#39;s decision. In an interview with Xinjing Bao, Chaoyang police claimed that Du had never asked Kris Wu for money. However, according to Du&#39;s recording that was subsequently exposed, Du had clear intentions and behavior to ask for money. ——Why can’t you get it right? Can&#39;t ask! The question is just stupid fans who don’t believe in GJF. Do Meizhu, as the court-appointed victim of QJ, flaunts her relationship with Kris Wu to everyone. I still have the chat history. ——Why can you show off your relationship even though you are a victim of QJ? What is the psychology behind this? Can&#39;t ask! Asking means that the chain of evidence is complete and cannot be questioned. And so on, there have been too many in the past two years, and my ears are almost calloused. Can I get fresh ones? Today I want to ask all my questions and see how many mouth-covering excuses I can receive. 1. As a victim of QJ, why did Du Mouzhu first choose to hype up the relationship instead of calling the police? 2. It is said that Du did not choose to call the police because Wu had strong capital? Then why did 42 of the 50 hot search positions on the day of the incident belong to Wu? 3. Wu Zhucai, who has strong capital, did not call the police. Does this mean that the person who said this believed that the police would indeed collude with capital? What if the police exist in collusion with capital? Then why can&#39;t you question it? After all, those who stand opposite Wu also have capital. 4. As a victim of QJ, why did Du Mouzhu not choose to call the police even though the police had already intervened? 5. Why, according to the accomplices’ accounts at the time, is it said that a senior from Nortel made suggestions for Du Mouzhu, but when the hype failed, he attacked QJ? 6. How to prove the so-called sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol in the first-instance report? Who proved the drunken sexual relationship two years ago? Is it just oral confession? Or are there any witness statements? Who are the witnesses? How many witnesses are there? What does the testimony look like? 7. Everyone says that the police can convict only if they have surveillance, but the report never mentions surveillance from beginning to end. If there is surveillance as evidence, why can&#39;t it be reported? Does no surveillance mean only confessions? 8. Everyone said that the Wu case involved minors, but the report never mentioned minors from beginning to end. On the other hand, if similar reports involved minors, their age would be clearly stated. So, is there no minor involved in Wu’s case? Is the underage claim a malicious rumor spread by a marketing account? 9. How were you convicted of the crime of gathering a crowd to rape four years ago? Is there monitoring? If there is surveillance, why can&#39;t it be reported? Or is it just an oral confession, because it is only an oral confession and cannot be reported? 10. Everyone says that the Wu case has a complete chain of evidence. Why has such a complete chain of evidence not been released yet? 11. There are obviously a lot of judgments in the QJ case, but why do they say that once the Wu case is involved, they say that the QJ case involves privacy and cannot publish the judgment? 12. To this day, many people still think that Wu went in because of other victims, not Du. But the fact is that Du Mouzhu is the victim. Why haven&#39;t any law enforcement officials mentioned this matter? 13. Why does one of the three victims reported online not even have a name? 14. Why is it that Mr. Wu is always able to pinpoint “either Zhengzhou, XJ, Tangshan, or Heilongjiang?” Is someone deliberately manipulating the timing of the Wu case? 15. Why were the media notified in advance of the Wu case’s criminal detention, arrest approval, first-instance hearing, and first-instance sentencing and required to publicize it according to official standards. Are you worried that yxh will discover doubts in its own discussion? Can we deduce from this that the Wu case cannot be discussed, is not allowed to be discussed, and cannot be discussed? 16. Why are all the accomplices now turning against each other and insisting that the Wu case only contained confessions and no physical evidence? ...Can anyone give me all the answers to all of the above?

507,"As I said early on, only people with low IQs would think that Du Meizhu was the victim in Wu Yifan&#39;s incident. Now that Du Meizhu is not far away from going to jail, she realizes that Wu Yifan is also one of the victims. The two of them are actually the same, but no one feels sorry for the other. In fact, Du Meizhu was supported by the capital of the opposite party targeting Wu Yifan and moved the latter down. How could Du Meizhu, a person with erroneous views, have so much energy to send Wu Yifan, a top figure, to prison? The capital behind it all wrote the script. Of course, Kris Wu must have been sentenced to prison because he broke the law, but you must know that there was no public trial from beginning to end in this incident. What does this mean? The lack of disclosure shows that Kris Wu himself agreed to plead guilty in this way. However, although Wu Yifan pleaded guilty and was imprisoned, it was not necessarily the terrible and disgusting crime that Wu Yifan said on the Internet. He was probably imprisoned for other crimes, not all for Du Mei Zhu. Now that Du Meizhu&#39;s crimes are gradually coming to light, Wu Yifan should be able to get a reduced sentence. But no matter what, I commented on this matter because I read through a script early on. It is certain that Wu Yifan is not a qualified idol, because if you have not committed a crime, the court will not sentence you for no reason, but Du Meizhu is acting like a good boy with impunity. That will never be tolerated.

If they encounter certain opportunities and grow up, they will form the image of a male leader, a courageous and big-headed man. mentality, coupled with the strong heart that they have learned through customer service and are not afraid of difficulties, they are unlikely to be bad in the future, which has enhanced their self-confidence, or they are born with a strong personality, and this kind of man has the chest-shaped leader mentality and temperament that is most attractive to women. The mentality of a man who can be relied on, instead of being tangled up and even depressed when a giant baby encounters setbacks and trivial matters, is too low-key. As long as the smart life is opened, everything will become smooth! What are the rules of the scientific material world, this is it! According to psychology, people who live their lives with this kind of mentality have a high chance of success in their careers. They are wise, courageous, and have a lot of details. Such people are even the top people who have worked hard for the older generation. The mentality of the older generation of gj leader-level people is also the moral bottom line they have. They also have many bad habits and even do bad things. They do whatever it takes for their own interests and still succeed later. This is how everyone is blessed by this mentality. It is a one-step choice, so I live a comfortable life, but when I reach a certain level, those things are not worth mentioning at all. I will still live a comfortable life. When I reach a certain level, I can better deal with my own desires, including various values and how to live my remaining life. In the next life, just let nature take its course, have desires, deal with desires and needs, and achieve happiness. It&#39;s that simple. The only thing in your mind is how to make yourself more comfortable. Never think about things that are not enough or even cause internal problems. There will be more in future generations. With better resources, he would have lived a comfortable life, even if he had done bad things, he would have lived a comfortable and wonderful life without any regrets. Therefore, it is enough to absorb these wisdom strategies that can change your mentality from the inside out. This is the intention that you want to retain. You also need these and then combine them with yourself to achieve the best self, the unique self. Coming to this world is to experience things that have never been experienced as much as possible. They only stay in subjective imagination and impressions without putting them into practice. Many people ask why people live this life. What they live for is why. This is the greatest meaning of life. For example, some For example, people born in the 1970s like their parents live for their children. Maybe this is the meaning of their lives. They take care of everything for themselves and it will end and they will have no regrets. I don’t understand it, but people are just like each other. If you are different, you cannot force it or change it, so just let her respect it, because this is likely to be a very meaningful and fulfilling thing, because you cannot impose your own values and outlook on life on others except yourself, because Everyone is an individual. Without heart-to-heart connection, even if you understand each other in a similar way, you will not be able to feel yourself or truly feel the feelings of the other person. Therefore, live a happy, perfect and happy life with what you think is a beautiful outlook on life. Just so what is the scientific world of matter, this is it! There won&#39;t be any ghosts, ghosts or snakes.

537,"Two days ago, Du Meizhu&#39;s former writer posted a long article on Weibo, detailing his journey over the past two years. In the article, he expressed his deep shame.

In June 2021, she revealed the news of being subjected to violence, but no one paid much attention. Then in July, she revealed that she had been raped. As soon as the essay was published, women&#39;s rights groups from all walks of life spoke out for her and held high the banner of women&#39;s rights to cheer for her. In just a few days, Du Meizhu&#39;s number of fans increased by 4 million. However, as time passed, things also changed, and the writer and a group of sisters turned against each other. The batch of lawsuits even attracted a lot of criticism, and his personality quickly collapsed. However, in the comment section of this writer, the fairies were furious. They had clearly described Du Meizhu as a representative of women&#39;s rights and the pride of women. Now after the writer expressed their dissatisfaction with women&#39;s rights, they began to say that Du Meizhu will be Meizhu confusing women&#39;s rights is stigmatizing women&#39;s rights. However, what is even more funny is that in the comment section of this writer, they accused others of writing short essays and even asked for evidence. Netizens commented: Wasn&#39;t Du Meizhu skinned by her best friend? She and her best friend teamed up to blackmail Kris Wu. Afterwards, Du Meizhu&#39;s influence greatly increased, and she and her best friend shared the spoils unevenly, so her best friend exposed Du Meizhu&#39;s old background. As soon as his boss was revealed, Du Meizhu&#39;s influence declined sharply. Now no one believes what Du Meizhu says.

601,"Among the legally recognized evidence, oral evidence is the most susceptible to change. As a kind of transmitted evidence, among all the recording evidence, the recording evidence of a person&#39;s voice is the one that cannot alone become the basis for finalizing a case. The apology letter two days ago contained a lot of inappropriate content, but I didn&#39;t expect that it was not sent out and that someone would use it for public discussion. As for what the letter said, if you want to use it as a basis for determining the facts, it is naturally far from enough. The topic concocted by some people about whether Kris Wu will reverse his conviction is really a bit wishful thinking. The practice of using some verbal evidence from surrounding people to prove the behavior of the relevant person in the opposite direction itself shows that the direct evidence related to the behavior of the relevant person is insufficient. When it comes to Wu Yifan and Du Meizhu&#39;s case, there are three theoretical outcomes: First, the man is guilty and the woman is not arrested. The second is that the woman is guilty but the man was not arrested. Third, both men and women were arrested. Wu Yifan has been sentenced, but what will happen to Du Meizhu?

715,"This world is just a huge grassroots team. Let’s talk to you about the people behind OpenAI. OpenAI&#39;s board of directors fired their CEO Ultraman at lightning speed. Later, someone went back on his word and wanted to bring Ultraman back, but the talks collapsed. During this process, Ultraman was very confused. He had just developed a very successful press conference, and everyone thought that OpenAI would be a company worth ten thousand US dollars. Then he was fired, and he built it with his own hands. Fired by the board of directors. Don’t think that foreigners can’t play corporate politics. On the contrary, companies in Silicon Valley are much better at playing corporate politics than Chinese Internet companies. Friends of ours who have worked on both sides said that in Chinese Internet companies, people’s desires are written on their faces. In Silicon Valley, people who seem harmless will discover one day that this person is actually a master, and the company&#39;s resources will go to him inexplicably. The master behind this time is Ilya, the chief scientist of OpenAI. Ilya actually has a very high status in the industry. He is a technical expert. He has published many papers and is the soul of the OpenAI research team. Generally speaking, everyone will think that people who engage in technology have no good ideas. Wrong! Without Ultraman being aware of it, Ilya suddenly obtained four votes out of the six members of the board of directors, and then asked a director to hold an online meeting with Ultraman and tell him: You are fired. Now, many core members of OpenAI have expressed support for Ultraman, and a group of people have resigned. As long as Ultraman starts another company, OpenAI will definitely split. Seeing this, you will think that this Ilya is a bad person, why is he so evil? not necessarily. Some people say that many technicians and researchers in this circle often support Ilya, while product managers and investors often support Ultraman. In fact, it&#39;s just that Ultraman usually faces the public more, and Ilya also plays a big role in OpenAI behind the scenes. The biggest difference between the two people is that Altman hopes to promote the productization and commercialization of AI technology faster, and OpenAI wants to become a trillion-dollar company faster. However, Ilya is particularly worried about the safety issues involved. If AI is allowed to develop too quickly without safety and ethical supervision, it will mean huge risks to human society. The reason why OpenAI is called Open is because the original purpose of this company was for public welfare. It hopes to make AI contribute to society and to be more open and avoid the monopoly of AI by one company. Therefore, Tesla CEO Musk was one of the earliest investors in OpenAI. He later quit angrily. He said that his taste had changed. Not pure anymore. The responsibility of the several external directors on the board of directors is to ensure the public welfare of OpenAI and to proceed from the perspective of human interests. From this perspective, they are indeed fulfilling their duties. So some people joked that people from the future might travel back and stop the development of OpenAI before AI gets out of control.

731,"Hello Xia Pei, things on openai have reversed again! Now some former employees have written an open letter to the board of directors exposing Sam and Greg’s bad behavior! I&#39;m really dumbfounded... What does Xia Pei think of this reversal? Answer: I read that letter, what is that reversal? There are really no words, even Greg used it to discriminate against transgender people. Clearly a letter from the left hand to the right hand of some organization. The content of this letter, as well as the timing of sending it, all convey the feeling of being extremely stupid and at the end of one&#39;s game. The most important thing is that it is obviously fake at first glance - if you hadn&#39;t come to me to tell me that it was reversed, I would only think it was a fake Internet rumor when I saw this letter. You wouldn&#39;t even think that this was coming from Sam&#39;s opponent - someone would believe such a fake thing. You can regard that kind of thing as a reversal. I doubt if you have read the Onion News, you will seriously think that it is a reversal, and then you will go around shouting about the reversal. The reason why there are so many rumors, false information and spiritual garbage on the Internet is because there are people like you who don’t even have basic discernment skills and like to spread gossip.

741,"Ultraman and OpenAI have reversed again and again. What we see is the conflict between different personalities, different opinions, and different ideas. At the same time, we also see the sense of rules and idealism reflected in their handling of things. And the bottom line, actually what I want to say the most is the last one, the bottom line. Some people compare this to a palace fight. In fact, they completely misunderstand everyone in it. People in a palace fight are for their own selfish purposes. They live and die, engage in intrigues, form gangs, and confuse right and wrong. Black and white, it’s not staged in Openai at all. It’s not accurate to call the behavior of Ultraman and other people a power struggle, because money and power have never been the focus of debate. On the contrary, what I see is They had a conflict over their ideals, responsibilities and responsibilities. This was definitely an amazing event.

Now, he is the chairman of OpenAI. In this dispute, both sides regard him as a neutral figure who will not cause controversy and is a person that everyone trusts. Bret has a kind, approachable personality and has a lot of good connections. In addition, it is worth mentioning that Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, is Sam Altman’s right-hand man.

745,"A letter purportedly written anonymously by a former OpenAI employee to the board of directors was exposed. It is said that the board of directors sent it to Musk and was directly exposed by Musk. Many OpenAI employees expressed condemnation and defense of Sam in response to the letter. The translation of the letter is as follows: To the OpenAI Board of Directors: As former employees who have worked at OpenAI, we are writing today to express our deep concern about recent events at the company, especially the allegations of misconduct against Sam Altman. We are former employees who left the company during a period of significant upheaval and change. Given that you&#39;ve seen with your own eyes what happens when someone dares to challenge Sam Altman, you may understand why many of us choose to remain silent out of fear of retaliation. But now, we can no longer remain silent. We believe the Board has a responsibility to fully investigate these allegations and take appropriate action. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you: - Broaden the scope of Emmett&#39;s investigation to include an examination of Sam Altman&#39;s conduct starting in August 2018, the beginning of OpenAI&#39;s transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity. - Launch a public call for private statements from former OpenAI employees who resigned, took medical leave, or were fired during this period. -Protect the identities of those who come forward and ensure they are not subject to retaliation or other forms of harm. We believe that many OpenAI employees were forced to leave in order to promote the company&#39;s transition to a profit model. This is evident from the company&#39;s employee turnover rate of up to 50% from January 2018 to July 2020. During our time at OpenAI, we witnessed disturbing deceptive and manipulative behavior displayed by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in their pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their actions raise serious questions about their true intentions and whether they truly put the interests of all humanity first. Initially, many of us were hopeful about OpenAI&#39;s mission and chose to believe in Sam and Greg. But as their behavior increasingly concerns us, those who dare to express dissent are silenced or forced to leave. This systematic suppression of dissent creates an atmosphere of fear and oppression that effectively stifles any substantive discussion of the ethical implications of OpenAI’s work. Concerning Sam and Greg&#39;s dishonest and manipulative behavior, we can provide specific examples: - Sam asked researchers to delay reporting on the progress of certain &quot;secret&quot; research programs, which were ultimately terminated because they failed to produce results quickly. Those who questioned this were deemed a &quot;culture misfit&quot; and even fired, some even on the eve of Thanksgiving 2019. -Greg once used discriminatory language toward a gender transition team member. Despite repeated promises to address the issue, no substantive steps were taken, other than Greg subsequently avoiding communication with the affected individuals, which in effect created a hostile work environment. The team member was eventually fired for poor performance. -Sam directed IT and operations staff to investigate employees, including Ilya, without management&#39;s knowledge or consent. -Sam secretly and routinely used OpenAI&#39;s non-profit resources to further his personal goals, particularly out of resentment following his break with Elon. -The operations team defaults to accepting the special rules that apply to Greg, cleverly avoiding complex requirements to avoid being blacklisted. -BradLightcap failed to fulfill its promise to publicly detail OpenAI’s limited profit structure and profit cap for each investor. -Sam&#39;s inconsistent commitment to research project calculation quotas, leading to internal mistrust and infighting. Although more and more evidence reveals Sam and Greg&#39;s fault, employees still at OpenAI still blindly follow their leadership, even if it may bring significant personal losses to themselves. This unwavering loyalty stems from fear of retaliation and the lure of possible financial gains through OpenAI’s profit-sharing unit. OpenAI&#39;s governance structure, carefully designed by Sam and Greg, intentionally excludes employees from overseeing profitable operations, primarily because of their inherent conflicts of interest. This opaque structure allowed Sam and Greg to operate with impunity and avoid accountability. We urge the OpenAI board of directors to take a firm stance against these unethical actions and initiate an independent investigation into Sam and Greg’s conduct. We firmly believe that OpenAI&#39;s mission is too important to be affected by the personal goals of a few people. We implore the board of directors to stick to OpenAI’s original mission and not succumb to the pressure of profit-oriented interests. The future of AI and the well-being of humanity depends on your unwavering commitment to ethical leadership and transparency. Sincerely, Concerned former OpenAI employees - One of the employees replied: I have been working at OpenAI for 7 years. During this period, I also came into contact with former employees who expressed concerns. But I think their accusations lack an understanding of the overall situation and appear immature. For example, we often have arguments about GPU allocation! Sam&#39;s job is to make decisions. Inevitably, there will always be people who are dissatisfied. We need to look at these issues more maturely. As for the attacks on Greg and Sam&#39;s personal qualities, I think they reflect more on the accusers themselves. These accusations are completely baseless. I have provided feedback directly to Greg many times and he always listens and takes action. I want to be clear: I also gave Sam a lot of feedback. I have never felt unsafe here, quite the opposite. I saw firsthand how compassionate he was in answering other people&#39;s biased questions. He is always very meticulous and thoughtful in dealing with the balance of safety and accuracy. ———The link to Musk’s original letter is no longer available, but here’s a backup: O Web link Second screenshot Tweet address: twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1727107165465243806Collapsed",493,0.01296974817266229,13,16,472,40,6,4,1,6,24,0,100.0,"[0.18615819829643787, 0.5193134711542597, 0.7297953905324696, 0.04054739170191635, 0.9347363248284137, 0.9334450726717274, 0.2585922661562702, 0.8908136777056972, 0.33427774468221494, 0.9454771972432333, 0.9947449107157202, 0.5262327818078083, 0.8002837845452041, 0.12774809147326938, 0.5172413793103444, 0.5262327818078083, 0.1344883934527098, 0.31227184393612784, 0.8530966709059733, 0.004965261068445526, 0.647702874738274, 0.5341706041346258, 0.5262327818078083, 0.4403798417047985, 0.7701305489940293, 0.02968701593692724, 0.09244889531126788, 0.30575391875461244, 0.7929591955939241, 0.5262327818078083, 0.4637012089852868, 0.9702805308792352, 0.9090909090909092, 0.9726558615577529, 0.5640173109240663, 0.7503505040250263, 0.8591333003733309, 0.8537353204255231, 0.41774610320515526, 0.40922900970321396, 0.9897528318717189, 0.6623480539710327, 0.14931203369706358, 0.5, 0.6633348640165709, 0.9909374058831865, 0.4463889076471639, 0.5402066014522188, 0.050130288965082315, 0.7522022509792519, 0.9766643374213123, 0.0001193642652543847, 0.14265708841523717, 0.999759006374893, 0.6961525005894309, 0.12577591734794658, 0.9564249583205541, 0.5140430994188441, 0.49676568790526543, 0.12525202727634233, 0.7982356718451518, 0.41664976441428936, 0.2640646986109908, 0.9995780379660449, 0.3489591667372349, 0.9682710374485256, 0.856182599523858, 0.7406670387247368, 0.49527589345369993, 0.28276157000842017, 0.20043703942562274, 0.2079765672857694, 0.9312311715200368, 0.6464719890366548, 0.9951466739093068, 0.9660199966301609, 0.9986434891279699, 0.5, 0.25350492085398524, 0.7249168947857072, 0.5262327818078083, 0.7672323899576745, 0.899492911325897, 0.5714285714285716, 0.6321844467865266, 0.33333333333333337, 0.8664258018029596, 0.7499999999999999, 0.6866011703226509, 0.9602851175729047, 0.9509679582085533, 0.6289210136901683, 0.23919101933146703, 0.29181324372906103, 0.5, 0.34882164413802785, 0.46953479092009787, 0.5262327818078083, 0.9412515608926444, 0.3686945088247987, 0.978193454183453, 0.7736932278396916, 0.007586066723931917]"
746,"Many people think chicken is vegetarian. Maybe it’s because the feed we feed chickens is mainly grain-based, at least when we raise them at home. In fact, if given a choice, chickens prefer to eat meat, even if it is KFC chicken. Chickens don&#39;t care if they are born from the same roots. Totally understandable. Meats are high-concentration energy packets. In an equal weight comparison, lean meat provides 14 times more calories than lettuce and 8.5 times more than blackberries - and this is based on modern varieties. The calories of meat have not changed substantially for thousands of years, but vegetables and fruits have undergone tremendous changes. Wild plants millions of years ago had much lower energy than they do now. Many birds survive on seeds and fruits because they are easily available. If they can catch meat, they prefer to eat meat, at least that&#39;s what the falcons think. Therefore, even birds that are usually vegetarian will try to give bugs instead of millet when feeding their chicks. The initial increase in human brain size may have been simply the result of dramatic changes in the environment. This increase is not large, but it is enough to make the cooperation ability of this ancient ape slightly better than other apes. With the ability to cooperate, you can hunt more efficiently and obtain more meat. The high energy of meat in turn promoted brain development. The two sides provided positive feedback to each other, and finally turned the ancient apes into today&#39;s Homo sapiens. Homo sapiens developed a silicon-based intelligence that does not eat meat and only eats electricity, and then let openAI stage a mutiny and war. The bloody plot of counter-mutiny... I digress.

According to people with contact with the board, identifying board members was one of the reasons for the delay in the decision to bring Altman back. OpenAI calls the new board its &quot;initial&quot; board, suggesting it may expand in the future. — &quot;Sam Altman returns to OpenAI as CEO&quot; - The decision caps a five-day turmoil for the artificial intelligence company. After some twists and turns, Sam Altman was reappointed as OpenAI’s CEO on Tuesday night. The company said it was successful in reversing last week&#39;s removal from the board of directors with strong support from Altman&#39;s allies, employees and investors. With Altman&#39;s return, the company&#39;s board of directors will also undergo drastic changes, eliminating some members who have opposed him. Only Quora&#39;s CEO, Adam D&#39;Angelo, remains in office. OpenAI released news on its X platform, announcing that it had agreed in principle to return Mr. Altman as CEO. &quot;We are collaborating to finalize the details. Thank you for your patience during this time.&quot; The return of Mr. Altman and company president Greg Brockman (who had previously resigned in an expression of solidarity), as well as the reorganization of the board of directors, capped a turbulent five days for OpenAI. Full stop. As the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, OpenAI is one of the most well-known artificial intelligence companies in the world. Mr. Altman posted on the relation. OpenAI&#39;s new board of directors will include early Facebook executives and former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and current board member D&#39;Angelo, CEO of question and answer website Quora. The company announced that Taylor will serve as chairman of the board of directors. Microsoft supports this. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the It is reported that D&#39;Angelo is leading the negotiations. By Sunday night, the broad outlines of the changes had taken shape. According to people with contact with the board, identifying board members was one of the reasons for the delay in the decision to bring Altman back. OpenAI calls the new board its &quot;initial&quot; board, suggesting it may expand in the future. A person close to the board discussions said D&#39;Angelo, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner asked Altman to make certain concessions, including an independent investigation into his leadership of OpenAI. Ultimately, Toner and McCauley agreed to resign from the board because they believed the board needed a fresh start. If they all resign, it could suggest the board made the wrong decision even though they unanimously believe they did the right thing. The previous board worked to limit Altman&#39;s power, including investigating his leadership and preventing him and Brockman from returning to the board, fearing they might not be able to take a tough stance against Altman. On Friday afternoon, the board unexpectedly told Altman that he was being forced out. Brockman resigned in protest. Altman, 38, and his allies in the tech community and OpenAI employees then began working to force the board to bring him back. After a weekend of negotiations, the board announced Sunday night that it stood by its decision. But hours later, things took a turn for the worse when Microsoft announced that Altman, Brockman and others would join the company to establish a new advanced artificial intelligence lab. When a majority of OpenAI&#39;s more than 700 employees signed a letter saying they would strike and follow Altman to Microsoft if he wasn&#39;t reappointed, it threw the startup&#39;s future into uncertainty. Four board members — OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, D&#39;Angelo, Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown&#39;s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and McCauley, a computer scientist and entrepreneur — initially decided to push Altman out. As the employee rebellion escalated, Sutskever began to have second thoughts: &quot;I deeply regret participating in the board&#39;s actions,&quot; he said on the X platform and signed the letter. Sutskever is no longer a board member but remains an OpenAI employee. &quot;Ilya is excited about Sam&#39;s return as CEO and has been working hard for many days to make this happen,&quot; said Alex Weingarten, Sutskever&#39;s attorney. “It’s the best thing for the company.” OpenAI’s employees were originally on holiday for Thanksgiving, but many remained in the office or glued to their screens to follow the incident. &quot;Thank God,&quot; one employee said. &quot;We&#39;re back at it again,&quot; another employee said. Thrive Capital, which led the new round of financing, said it will continue to work with OpenAI &quot;now and in the future.&quot; On Tuesday night, OpenAI employees celebrated at the company&#39;s offices. Altman called a New York Times reporter and said, &quot;Have a happy Thanksgiving.&quot;",372,0.08410679938339741,12,5,368,28,12,2,1,1,7,0,100.0,"[0.8632128624904281, 0.9618430066550491, 0.5509805171630423, 0.8663872640818208, 0.7949776861493306, 0.6110062900136304, 0.10154988458705805, 0.6013137604057008, 0.2500000000000001, 0.7351394293979996, 0.713295677361736, 0.5, 0.10578153937684731, 0.26966403829795327, 0.9826950376991637, 0.9066951068988347, 0.988226686074281, 0.8302515641563177, 0.760265350813399, 0.23751259167625072, 0.5858684619410882, 0.08948223531621169, 0.4777448071216617, 0.9465353903933252, 0.7491613442037861, 0.9386694771799367, 0.9362480169482628, 0.9840121223373378, 0.663404283225601, 0.2434377368247711, 0.9789021274607268, 0.7499999999999999, 0.7981221324253435, 0.6178524870347417, 0.9586311148632, 0.391383654489703, 0.6773298880891506, 0.6501958430224095, 0.4002397449247378, 0.6921929360695218, 0.6988793084090733, 0.9932067633883207, 0.8977071835001503, 0.5460639951575114, 0.13599455320864973, 0.8471464990141354, 0.8904199078673448, 0.9813660973322781, 0.9983392980780447, 0.5, 0.10578153937684731, 0.26966403829795327, 0.9826950376991637, 0.9066951068988347, 0.988226686074281, 0.8302515641563177, 0.760265350813399, 0.8973276840357519, 0.2943467376859128, 0.3570966646090271, 0.6356589147286823, 0.10154988458705805, 0.6013137604057008, 0.2500000000000001, 0.7351394293979996, 0.713295677361736, 0.9926207705103613, 0.40911569387589986, 0.42187459753097767, 0.05788731800281366, 0.6526950683364353, 0.8680655151082968, 0.4365170184726288, 0.0512657746883205, 0.34298621045831235, 0.9323372130529384, 0.25208878538525537, 0.2613671387014612, 0.4392359418933317, 0.7645876600797913, 0.8443597782779612, 0.3688066004788254, 0.40493911112242953, 0.19185025305106962, 0.8606199121706068, 0.9779124775267983, 0.9998804592732524, 0.5362239738232598, 0.5228930758249711, 0.5292795704249764, 0.07247356833933238, 0.8924252432636439, 0.4069654631130596, 0.9127785763876445, 0.5509805171630423, 0.8663872640818208, 0.7949776861493306, 0.4622837642948726, 0.6184442904041151, 0.6562281657009975, 0.240440535791138, 0.46328671328671334, 0.240440535791138, 0.8854619211332234, 0.665496594894056, 0.09972350085749504, 0.3658265967747185, 0.9769813030145337, 0.3045814468088155]"

Big data is very dangerous for AI. Conservatives believe that if this continues, artificial intelligence will be out of control in the hands of Ultraman and will deviate from the original intention of science. However, since the beginning of Sino-US cooperation, China will sell a large amount of data to the United States in the future, not only personal information, but also behavioral information. After consuming a large amount of data, AI will become smarter and more profitable. From a business perspective, Microsoft cannot sit back and watch Ultraman be eliminated, affecting investment.

753,The farce finale of OpenAI&#39;s removal: the father of ChatGPT returns and establishes a new board of directors | AI Outpost,17,0.0,0,0,19,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,100.0,[0.9999999999760463]
754,"Microsoft has promised to recruit almost all OpenAI members, including the two founders of ChatGPT, to join their new AI R&amp;D division. It is said that Microsoft is the fisherman who gets the advantage, but it seems that Microsoft is the one playing chess. Wouldn’t it be nice to take out OpenAI and have the final say? Sam Altman, the father of ChatGPT, a leader in the field of generative AI, and one of the co-founders of OpenAI, was suddenly kicked out by the board of directors, and the market was confused. Who is OpenAI? The most handsome guy in the technology world today is known as the biggest technological revolution since the emergence of smartphones. Why bother killing each other when the limelight is at its peak? Many people don’t know that this company was originally a non-profit company, non-profit! They were established in December 2015. The six founders, including Musk, are all American technology leaders. Their establishment is not just as simple as an innovative company, but they want to use superhuman wisdom to break the monopoly of technology giants on AI research, just like their current monopoly on the entire technology industry: &quot;Our mission is to benefit all mankind. Artificial intelligence.” It’s always good to have dreams. But setting off with a dream does not mean that the dream can support a sailing voyage. With Microsoft&#39;s first injection of US$1 billion, OpenAI emerged from its shell as OpenAILP, which focuses on profitability. But OpenAI has always been wary of investors. First, although investors have a return limit, which is 100 times. For an investment of US$1, you can get back up to US$100. Secondly, in theory, the commercialization process and whether it is profitable must adhere to OpenAI&#39;s mission. That is, &quot;mission is more important than profit.&quot; Today, Microsoft holds 49%, other shareholders hold 49%, and the remaining 2% is owned by the original OpenAI non-profit fund. This 2% is also the original intention of OpenAI. Which capital can bear this? Which capital doesn’t want to be wiped out? What does the fate of human beings have to do with me? ? ? ChatGTP5.0, which is currently being launched, will have &quot;superintelligence&quot;. Ultraman obviously has his own ideas about the profitability of ChatGPT. He is eager to immediately build an AI sharing platform similar to Apple, so that AI will come like a storm and profits will rain down! This was a big step, and Microsoft and investors were naturally happy, but several other board members couldn&#39;t bear it and kicked him out. On the one hand, there are science students who are worried about mankind, and they are afraid that walking too fast will create a devil that will eventually devour mankind; on the other hand, there are big capital hungry for money, and they are afraid that making money is too slow! OpenAI has too many shackles, which is probably the root of this drama. Microsoft, it seems, is poaching people openly and covertly, eager to poach all these valuable engineers. By then, OpenAI will become an empty shell, and Microsoft will have the final say on how it wants to make money. Screw the dream, screw the idea of benefiting all of humanity, screw the fight against the monopoly of Big Tech. In the final analysis, what humans can never fight against is not AI but their own greed.

755,"Shear was fired within just 15 minutes of Sam Altman&#39;s return as OpenAI&#39;s CEO, which seemed to indicate that Altman would receive a generous salary. Meanwhile, the board is undergoing a technology-oriented restructuring that favors Altman&#39;s views. But it begs the question: How will Larry Summers&#39; character change? In addition, Microsoft, as a financial technology company, has gained more control over the OpenAI product roadmap through this change. This move means that Microsoft will play a more important role in OpenAI&#39;s operations, and it also means that the company does not need to pay high costs for new employees. This series of changes has had a profound impact on the future development of OpenAI and its partnership with Microsoft. ChatGPTCollapsed",98,0.10341485139069297,2,0,100,5,3,0,0,2,0,0,100.0,"[0.6088866856699292, 0.38346738778242584, 0.4737672181921908, 0.5750099749388252, 0.5262327818078083, 0.5006906013669579, 0.7860202516008576, 0.9929812064885388, 0.5262327818078083, 0.9929518410919349, 0.8672371469612226, 0.9892345093788878, 0.03238807126014687, 0.9825813109148354, 0.44767845850986676]"

757,"Just as I was about to fall asleep, three big news came one after another, all closely related to the stock market! News 1: The wholesale price of Moutai 1935 fell below 1,000 yuan, and the prices of some channel dealers have been &quot;upside down.&quot; Interpretation: Some time ago, Moutai announced a price increase, and the reaction of the secondary market was to open higher and move lower, which means that the market did not buy it, because if the high-premium Feitian increased by 20%, it would not have any impact on terminal sales. After all, The current premium has long exceeded 20%, but the same cannot be said for other varieties. For example, Maotai 1935 has begun to rise upside down. Even for Maotai, the price increase is under great pressure, let alone other brands of liquor. The price increase has almost become Extravagant expectations, so the market still has a cold attitude towards liquor. News 2: OpenAI officially announced that Ultraman has returned to the company as CEO and the board of directors has initiated a &quot;reset&quot;. Interpretation: Ultraman&#39;s farce is really one version a day. He was fired first, then Microsoft officially announced that Ultraman will join, and today he returns to OpenAI. The core reason for the repeated pull is the issue of interests, and the commercial value of OpenAI is real It&#39;s too big. Everyone is considering their own interests, so this farce happens. What implications does this news have for our investments? On the one hand, there is no clear implementation scenario for artificial intelligence at present, and it may be overestimated. However, in the long run, the value of commercialization is huge, and it is a must-win for large companies. It also warns investors that who can use artificial intelligence? You will have the last laugh, everything is unknown, so don’t take over at a high position, because even if artificial intelligence is widely used in the future, it may not be certain that the company you hold will still exist. News 3: The Beijing Securities 50 Index rose 16% in three days, two stocks doubled their share prices, and 18 stocks rose more than 50%. Interpretation: The biggest hot spot in the market these days is the North Exchange. On the one hand, the authorities intend to revitalize the North Exchange. There are also rumors that the account opening rate of the North Exchange will reach 80%. Stimulated by favorable policies, the North Exchange will be superimposed. The market value of the companies in the index is relatively small, and it is easy for hot money to participate. There has been a continuous surge in the past few days. The index has increased by an astonishing 16% in three days, and individual stocks have even doubled in three days. There has been an obvious money-making effect. This kind of The atmosphere will naturally attract a large amount of speculative funds, but this kind of participation is more of a purely hype nature. To put it bluntly, it is a game of drumming and passing flowers. If you want to participate, you can. After all, the attitude from above is mostly encouraging, but you must give up when things are good. After all, no one is very clear about the fundamentals of these companies. It all depends on who has the biggest imagination and who rises. Much more. Finally, let’s talk about the market. The short-term market is very clear. The last wave stabilized and rebounded without falling through. Therefore, a second step back to confirm is needed. Now that the second foot has been initially formed, the next step is to wait for this second step. When the two legs are completely formed, the market will form a synergy by then, and it is very likely to form a large-scale New Year&#39;s Eve market. Before the market gives a clear rebound signal, everyone should keep some positions and wait for the buying point to appear. It’s time to take action.

777,"Just as I was about to fall asleep, three big news came one after another, all closely related to the stock market! News 1: The wholesale price of Moutai icon 1935 fell below 1,000 yuan, and the prices of some channel dealers have been &quot;upside down.&quot; Interpretation: Some time ago, Moutai announced a price increase, and the reaction of the secondary market was to open higher and move lower, which means that the market did not buy it, because if the high-premium Feitian increased by 20%, it would not have any impact on terminal sales. After all, The current premium has long exceeded 20%, but the same cannot be said for other varieties. For example, Maotai 1935 has begun to rise upside down. Even for Maotai, the price increase is under great pressure, let alone other brands of liquor. The price increase has almost become Extravagant expectations, so the market still has a cold attitude towards liquor. News 2: OpenAIicon officially announced that Ultraman has returned to the company as CEO and the board of directors has initiated a &quot;reset&quot;. Interpretation: Ultraman&#39;s farce is really one version a day. First he was fired, then Microsoft icon officially announced that Ultraman has joined, and today he returns to OpenAI. The core reason for the repeated pull is the issue of interests and the commercial value of OpenAI. It&#39;s really too big. Everyone is considering their own interests, so this farce happens. What implications does this news have for our investments? On the one hand, there is no clear implementation scenario for artificial intelligence at present, and it may be overestimated. However, in the long run, the value of commercialization is huge, and it is a must-win for large companies. It also warns investors that who can use artificial intelligence? You will have the last laugh, everything is unknown, so don’t take over at a high position, because even if artificial intelligence is widely used in the future, it may not be certain that the company you hold will still exist. News 3: The Beijing Securities 50 Index rose 16% in three days, two stocks doubled their share prices, and 18 stocks rose more than 50%. Interpretation: The biggest hot spot in the market these days is the North Exchange icon. On the one hand, the authorities intend to revitalize the North Exchange. There are also rumors that the account opening rate of the North Exchange will reach 80%. Stimulated by favorable policies, the North Exchange is also superimposed. The market value of the companies in the index is relatively small, and it is easy for hot money to participate. There has been a continuous surge in the past few days. The index has increased by an astonishing 16% in three days, and individual stocks have even doubled in three days. There has been an obvious money-making effect. This This kind of atmosphere will naturally attract a large amount of speculative funds, but this kind of participation is more of a purely hype nature. To put it bluntly, it is a game of drumming and passing flowers. If you want to participate, you can. After all, the attitude from above is mostly encouraging, but you must give up when things are good. After all, no one is very clear about the fundamentals of these companies. It all depends on who has the biggest imagination and who rises. Much more. Finally, let’s talk about the market. The short-term market is very clear. The last wave stabilized and rebounded without falling through. Therefore, a second step back to confirm is needed. Now that the second foot has been initially formed, the next step is to wait for this second step. When the two legs are completely formed, the market will form a synergy by then, and it is very likely to form a large-scale New Year&#39;s Eve market. Before the market gives a clear rebound signal, everyone should keep some positions and wait for the buying point to appear. It’s time to take action.

780,"The history I have read is reflected in reality, and it turns out to be so enlightening. In 1956, Shockley brought a group of top young people to California to establish his own transistor laboratory. That was the most critical period. Just waiting for the implementation of silicon transistor technology, a new future with mobile communications and high-speed computers could come. This is why Shockley made up his mind to leave Bell Labs and come to California. Colleagues at Bell Labs had extensive experience, but had objections to Shockley&#39;s management style and declined the offer. It is worth mentioning that Shockley selfishly requires young people who join to complete IQ tests and psychological assessments. He does not want any management talents to replace him. At the end of the year, Shockley won the Nobel Prize and stood on the podium in Stockholm, Sweden. But this year, the company still did not develop a profitable product, and the core talents were also in the research direction. The differences with Shockley became more and more serious. They argued many times but failed. Finally, the top scientists resigned collectively, and Shockley angrily called them the &quot;eight rebels.&quot; After the eight rebels left, they founded Fairchild Semiconductor. Here, semiconductor companies such as Intel and AMD emerged, completely changing the entire industry. Since then, California has become &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. As top scientists, they clearly knew that they were capable at that time and were standing closest to the future. They only wanted one goal, a goal that they could achieve and change the world - the world&#39;s first commercial diffused silicon transistor, but Shockley was obsessed with PNPN diodes. The outstanding top scientists of OpenAI used six words in their application form and vowed to follow Sam. Their loyalty and respect were so extreme that it was puzzling. History seems to be repeating itself here, with AI scientists standing in a rebellious position for half a century. Now, AI researchers urgently need a team leader who clearly knows how to achieve the goal and refuses any delays in the process - firsttoAGI. Eight Rebels wasted a year in Shockley Lab to learn the most important lesson - focus. Those top scientists must know it better than me, so they don&#39;t need to stay in the remaining OpenAI and repeat the same mistakes. History reflects reality, and everything is always simple.

783,"Preliminary summary: Their cry of OpenAI is nothing without its people means that after changing jobs, personnel can either take these technical achievements as their own, or they can continue to use them legally (nominally they still belong to the former employer). This confirms that the current legal environment in the United States cannot define AI technological achievements. Property rights cannot be defined, contracts and enterprises are just castles in the air, and trying to show off is just a show. Whether a person watching a play or talking about a play is trapped in the play depends on whether he has first defined property rights. In an environment where property rights can be usurped at will, the employees who handle them are the natural controllers. Cooperative enterprises established based on employees are the most accurate external reflection of this natural process. The mission of representing all mankind will not be much smaller than that of the United Nations if it is institutionalized. In fact, OpenAI turned in a blank and did not even begin to establish a system that represents all mankind. At the same time, no attempt was made to define property rights, and no system was established to reflect the natural right of control (the right to steal). So the overall assessment is that the board of directors, including Altman, has been sleepwalking. Not to mention the other positions they hold concurrently, this position of director is a collective dereliction of duty.

786,"[,] On November 22, Beijing time, OpenAI officially tweeted that it had reached an agreement in principle to allow Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO, and to form a team led by Brett Taylor. Bret Taylor, Larry Summers and Adam D&#39;Angelo are working together to figure out the details. Previous rumors in the industry claimed that one of Altman’s prerequisites for returning to OpenAI was to reorganize a board of directors and governance structure. OpenAI&#39;s unique board of directors structure is one of the important reasons for this &quot;coup&quot;. Its structure was originally mainly based on non-profit characteristics. In addition to Altman and Gregg, there were four other members who made the decision to remove - Chief Scientist Yi Ilya Sutskever, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner (Helen Toner) et al. China Business News reporter noticed that among the original OpenAI board members, only Adam DeAngelo is on the new board list. He is the CEO of the question and answer community Quora, and is the same as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. A prep school classmate, he contributed to the birth of Facebook while studying at Caltech, and then became Facebook&#39;s first chief technology officer, but left in June 2008. There are also two new board members. Among them, Brett Taylor once worked at Google. He was the co-founder of Google Maps and the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API), and promoted the establishment of the Google Developer Product Group. In June 2010, Facebook appointed Brett Taylor as chief technology officer (CTO). In November 2021, Twitter announced that Brett Taylor was appointed chairman. Another new board member, Summers, is a famous American economist and director of the National Economic Council. He served as the 71st U.S. Secretary of the Treasury during the Clinton era, served as the president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006, and headed the National Economic Council (NEC) from 2009 to 2011, becoming the chief architect of Obama&#39;s economic policies. Although the core reason for the &quot;coup&quot; has not been disclosed, Ilya, the main figure who launched the recall action, and Tasha and Helen, the conservatives who advocate AI safety, are no longer on the new board of directors.

798,"Five days after being kicked out of the company, Sam Altman finally took back his CEO position. The ups and downs of OpenAI’s power struggle have come to an end. A quick review of the incident: On the 17th, Altman was fired from the OpenAI board of directors, which attracted widespread attention; on the 20th, Altman failed to negotiate with the board of directors and announced that he would join Microsoft; on the same day, nearly 95% of OpenAI employees threatened to resign, demanding that the board of directors step down and Altman return. . It is not surprising that Altman, who has absolute control over the hearts and minds of the people, won. Returning with him is former OpenAI president Greg Brockman. In this incident, he and Altman were expelled from the board of directors, and then announced his resignation to follow Altman. With Altman&#39;s return, the OpenAI board of directors, which single-handedly created the turmoil, has also been reorganized.

804,"Recently, the concept of paid film and television short dramas has become quite popular around the world. They are serial dramas made from some cool Internet articles, and each episode lasts only a few minutes. For example, &quot;The Domineering President&#39;s Contracted Wife&quot;, &quot;The Newly Divorced Husband Is Turned Out to Be a Billionaire Heir&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye My Domineering President&quot;. Just by looking at the titles, you can tell that they are very straightforward and enjoyable dramas. The audiences of these dramas are basically older, less educated, and poorer income groups. Since each episode of these dramas is very short, it is decided that the content of each episode must be relatively impactful, otherwise it will be difficult to attract viewers to pay for the next episode. However, such high-frequency orgasms will, over time, raise the brain&#39;s threshold for dopamine reward, and eventually lose the ability to process information for some complex and logical content. In fact, the continuous development of information technology has lowered the threshold for humans to receive information and weakened humans&#39; ability to process information. From speeches to books to newspapers to telegrams to television to blogs to Weibo to WeChat to short videos, information is constantly fragmented. In such an information environment, the human brain&#39;s ability to process information is actually weakened. For example, many people now have lost the ability to read long books, lose the ability to write letters, and even lose the ability to watch a movie in its entirety. This is one of the reasons why I write and read every day, to combat this trend of weakening my ability to process information. In addition, I will accompany the young master to do his homework today, and he will ask me some questions that he does not know. For example, how to form a word with a certain character? How to write a certain word? Today I taught him a new method - using Wen Xin Yi Yan APP. Let Ai teach him his homework. After teaching him how to use it, he discovered a problem, that is, his questions to Ai were not accurate enough, and Ai gave wrong answers. For example, he asked Ai how to form a word with the word &quot;qi&quot;, and Ai answered with the word &quot;qi&quot;. The correct way to ask is &quot;How can I form a word with the starting character &quot;qi&quot;?&quot; Of course, I will also teach him how to set a certain identity for Ai later to help him learn. Adults are no better than children. In my work, I need to deal with a large number of various people, and it is very important to effectively receive and transmit information during the process of dealing with them. Sometimes precise questions can help you understand something quickly and efficiently. I have seen many people who don’t know how to express something clearly, so they need me to guide them with questions one by one. Openai recently released gpts, which does not require coding. You can create and publish an APP using natural language. Theoretically, everyone can use this function to make the tools they want, but the vast majority of people no longer have this kind of logical ability, expression ability and systematic thinking ability. In the future, it will not be the tools that will eliminate people, but the people who use the tools.

805,"1. Things that require patience to buy are the most expensive things in the world. 2. Most people want shortcuts, and shortcuts are easy to teach, but shortcuts are not very useful. There are no shortcuts to success. 3. The essential characteristic of compound interest is its slowness. Morgan Hauser (author) says: “Most great things in life—from love to careers to investments—get their value from two things: *patience* and *scarcity*.” You’re going to Have the patience to wait for things to grow, and they will be scarce when they grow. 4. Schopenhauer once said: &quot;For a young man, if he has insight into people&#39;s affairs and is familiar with the world very early, if he quickly knows how to interact with others and deal with them, and enters society confidently, then no matter what This is a bad sign, both from an intellectual and moral point of view. It portends a mediocre nature. On the contrary, a young man is surprised and surprised by the ways of the world and behaves clumsily in his dealings with them. , eccentric, it shows that he has noble qualities.&quot; 5. Why? Because people who grow slowly have their own ideas. Even if you have the conditions at home, don’t overpower the situation. Those who grow slowly are the ones who are scarce. One of the difficulties of growing slowly is loneliness, no one pays attention to you. People prefer to focus on bad news. Buffett has a saying: &quot;It takes twenty years to build a reputation, and only five minutes to destroy it.&quot; 6. From 1950 to 2014, the death rate from heart disease in the United States decreased by more than 70%, which means that 25 million fewer people died. people. That&#39;s a huge number and a remarkable achievement, but it&#39;s never headline news. why? Because the gains were achieved gradually, the mortality rate dropped by only 1.5% per year on average. In contrast, if 25 million more people suddenly died in a certain year, it would definitely be a major event of historical significance. 7. Things are always like this. There are very few ground-breaking technological breakthroughs like GPT-4. Good things often come by iterating a little bit here today and a little bit there tomorrow. Each invention stands on the shoulders of other inventions that people might have thought were useless before. And even GPT-4 achieved breakthroughs after experiencing countless confusions and entanglements. We just saw a big new twist this week when Sam Altman was ousted from the OpenAI board of directors. 8. Hauser gave several examples to illustrate that the &quot;good things&quot; in nature are often things that grow slowly. For example, trees: Small trees in the forest can only grow in the gaps between big trees. Big trees will block most of the sunlight, leaving very little for small trees, which makes small trees grow very slowly. This was true for the first few decades. But precisely because it grows slowly, the tree will grow dense and hard, and will be strong. Someone did an experiment and planted the same tree in an unobstructed open space around it, allowing it to fully enjoy the sun from an early age. It will indeed grow rapidly. However, fast-growing trees are not dense enough and have soft wood that is prone to fungus and disease. A forest expert said: If a tree grows quickly, it will rot quickly, and it will never have the chance to grow old. The same goes for animals. In one experiment, the same fry were divided into two groups, one group was placed in cold water to grow, and the other group was given warm water. As expected, fish in cold water grow slowly, while fish in warm water grow fast. When these fish are adults, gather them together and see how they live. The result is that the slow-growing fish live 30% longer than the average lifespan, and the fast-growing fish live 15% less. This principle is that part of the resources in an organism are always used for growth, and part is used to repair existing cell tissues. If it grows fast, it means that more resources are used for growth, and repair cannot keep up, so there will be a lot of tissue damage in the grown body; conversely, if it grows slowly, it can be repaired carefully. ,Lay the foundation. It&#39;s like building a machine. You don&#39;t want the car you buy to be made by workers working overtime to meet the deadline. People always say &quot;lay a good foundation&quot;, and this is the underlying principle. 9. Hauser said that at least 90% of investment mistakes are caused by investors acting too hastily. For example, Starbucks: In 1994, it only had 425 branches. In 1999, it opened 625 new branches... By 2007, it had opened 2,500 new stores every year - but its sales did not Grow like you planned. In 2008, Starbucks&#39; stock price fell by 73% and it laid off 12,000 employees. Why? Just like small trees and small fish, if they grow too fast, their quality will decrease. If you use these resources to open new stores, you cannot use them to improve consumer experience. An entrepreneur once said it best: A company getting business too quickly is like a boy getting money too quickly - you can&#39;t hold it. Growth is not a strategy, you cannot grow for the sake of growth. You need to be patient. 10. Patience is not asking for trouble, but the reason why great things progress slowly is because it is particularly difficult. 11. Scarcity and efficiency are incompatible. Something worth pursuing must be something difficult to pursue. We don&#39;t like easy, we like hard. Difficulty means that the upper limit is high, it means that there is a lot of room for maneuver, and it means that there is a head start. Only difficulty can throw off our opponents and make us stand out. 12. When you encounter difficulties and are so difficult that you doubt your life, should you persist or give up? The criteria are simple: look for scarcity. Scarcity means worth it.

812,"Three major pieces of news followed one after another, all closely related to the stock market! News 1: The wholesale price of Moutai 1935 fell below 1,000 yuan, and the prices of some channel dealers have been &quot;upside down.&quot; Interpretation: Some time ago, Moutai announced a price increase, and the reaction of the secondary market was to open higher and move lower, which means that the market did not buy it, because if the high-premium Feitian increased by 20%, it would not have any impact on terminal sales. After all, The current premium has long exceeded 20%, but the same cannot be said for other varieties. For example, Maotai 1935 has begun to rise upside down. Even for Maotai, the price increase is under great pressure, let alone other brands of liquor. The price increase has almost become Extravagant expectations, so the market still has a cold attitude towards liquor. News 2: OpenAI officially announced that Ultraman has returned to the company as CEO and the board of directors has initiated a &quot;reset&quot;. Interpretation: Ultraman&#39;s farce is really one version per day. He was fired first, then Microsoft officially announced that Ultraman will join, and today he returns to OpenAI. The core reason for the repeated pull is the issue of interests, and the commercial value of OpenAI is real It&#39;s too big. Everyone is considering their own interests, so this farce happens. What implications does this news have for our investments? On the one hand, there is no clear implementation scenario for artificial intelligence at present, and it may be overestimated. However, in the long run, the value of commercialization is huge, and it is a must-win for large companies. It also warns investors that who can use artificial intelligence? You will have the last laugh, everything is unknown, so don’t take over at a high position, because even if artificial intelligence is widely used in the future, it may not be certain that the company you hold will still exist. News 3: The North Securities 50 Index rose 16% in three days, two stocks doubled their share prices, and 18 stocks rose more than 50%. Interpretation: The biggest hot spot in the market these days is the North Exchange. On the one hand, the authorities intend to revitalize the North Exchange. There are also rumors that the account opening rate of the North Exchange will reach 80%. Stimulated by favorable policies, the North Exchange will be superimposed. The market value of the companies in the index is relatively small, and it is easy for hot money to participate. There has been a continuous surge in the past few days. The index has increased by an astonishing 16% in three days, and individual stocks have even doubled in three days. There has been an obvious money-making effect. This kind of The atmosphere will naturally attract a large amount of speculative funds, but this kind of participation is more of a purely hype nature. To put it bluntly, it is a game of drumming and passing flowers. If you want to participate, you can. After all, the attitude from above is mostly encouraging, but you must give up when things are good. After all, no one is very clear about the fundamentals of these companies. It all depends on who has the biggest imagination and who rises. Much more. Finally, let’s talk about the market. The short-term market is very clear. The last wave stabilized and rebounded without falling through. Therefore, a second step back to confirm is needed. Now that the second foot has been initially formed, the next step is to wait for this second step. When the two legs are completely formed, the market will form a synergy by then, and it is very likely to form a large-scale New Year&#39;s Eve market. Before the market gives a clear rebound signal, everyone should keep some positions and wait for the buying point to appear. It’s time to take action.

821,"Altman returns to OpenAI, what compromises were made, and what does the new board of directors mean? According to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, OpenAI said that Sam Altman will return to the artificial intelligence startup he co-founded as a new director. CEO, ending a dramatic five-day standoff between him and the board that fired him. OpenAI said the two sides are &quot;collaborating on the details.&quot; The company announced a new initial board of directors that does not include three of the four board members involved in ousting Altman. The new board will include former Salesforce co-CEO Brett Taylor, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Adam DeAngelo, the only remaining member of OpenAI’s former board. The appointment of Brett Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce and chairman of Twitter, and Summers, a former Treasury secretary and president of Harvard University, surprised some observers. Adam DeAngelo, a former Facebook executive and founder of question-and-answer site Quora, said Taylor will serve as chairman. Altman will not be on the original board, including DeAngelo&#39;s retention, could be a sign that Altman may not have everything his way after his dramatic reinstatement late Tuesday. The former board and Altman&#39;s camp also agreed to conduct an independent investigation into his conduct, the decision to oust him last week and its aftermath, a person familiar with the matter said. The new board is expected to include up to six additional members, in addition to continuing to carry out its duties. After the news was released, Altman posted on A big win for Microsoft. Microsoft CEO Nadella publicly supported Altman throughout the turmoil and briefly agreed to hire him to start a new internal research group at Microsoft. The two new board members are also attractive to Wall Street and Silicon Valley figures. Summers also sits on the boards of several startups, including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey&#39;s Block. Taylor is a director at Shopify, where he was involved in Twitter&#39;s sale to Elon Musk last year. played a role in. Since the board unexpectedly fired Altman last Friday, investors have been urging directors to reinstate him, employees have threatened to resign en masse, and Microsoft, OpenAI&#39;s biggest backer, said it would hire him to lead a new Advanced artificial intelligence research team. The startup&#39;s technology, which Microsoft&#39;s artificial intelligence strategy hinges on, will likely get a seat on the new board, certainly as an observer and possibly one or more seats, one of the people said. Altman initially agreed not to serve on the board of directors in order to complete the deal. He may well end up joining the board. He also agreed to an internal investigation into the conduct that led to his firing, another person familiar with the matter said. Altman and his camp have been pushing for his reinstatement as OpenAI CEO and board member over the past few days, people familiar with the discussions said. Altman also pushed for the resignation of all previous directors. The board initially rejected the requests. The resolution that emerged late Tuesday divided the divide. While Altman is back as CEO, neither he nor OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who resigned in protest on Friday (and is also returning to the company), has been reinstated to the board. Meanwhile, of the four board members who initially decided to oust Altman, only D&#39;Angelo, CEO of question-and-answer service Quora, will remain on the board. Three other directors will step down. The three board members are: Ilya Sutskver, Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, and entrepreneur and computer scientist Tasha McCauley. &quot;Now, we can all sleep peacefully,&quot; Toner posted late Tuesday. &quot;Ultraman&#39;s return also raises other questions, including how this crisis will leave scars on everyone involved in the aftermath. Former Twitch CEO Emmett Hill, who has been named one of two interim CEOs of OpenAI since Friday, posted on X that he was &quot;deeply relieved by this outcome.&quot; Hill wrote : &quot;This is a path that maximizes safety and benefits all stakeholders. I&#39;m excited to be part of the solution. &quot;Many details remain unclear, including what role, if any, Microsoft will play on the expanded board. It&#39;s also unclear whether the board will make changes to provide more protection for investors. OpenAI was founded in 2015 In 2016, it was governed by a non-profit organization with a board of directors dedicated to making artificial general intelligence safe and accessible to all. According to OpenAI’s website, under this structure, the board of directors is not obligated to protect investors’ returns but rather to ensure that the company’s technology Good for humanity. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on An important first step on the road to governance. &quot;Altman said that with the new board of directors and the support of Nadella, he looks forward to returning to OpenAI and building a strong partnership with the software giant.

832,"[Wei Liang:] On November 22, Wei Liang, deputy director of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, said on the Internet that people are moving towards general artificial intelligence. It has only been a year since ChatGPT came out last year, and a lot has changed. ChatGPT4 has learned all human knowledge before April 2023, and can memorize massive parameters based on knowledge. For example, the software industry has undergone great changes. The data in some industries needs to be managed and standardized, but there are no good data scientists. The software industry is different. Good software and good programs are recognized by everyone. With these corpus and data sets, we can output good results. In software engineering, large models already have very good applications. Since its release, GitHubCopilot has written 46% of the code for more than 1 million developers. In 5 years, it is expected that 80% of the code will be generated by AI. Some software companies no longer need so many programmers. Artificial intelligence can be used for many things, and this indeed improves efficiency and reduces personnel.

862,"In the American TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, there is a classic line: Chaos is not an abyss, chaos is a ladder! OpenAI’s palace battles these days prove this statement. As an investor and partner, Microsoft exercised restraint at critical moments, established good relations with Ultraman and OpenAI, who were fired at the time, and stabilized the stock price. It was a masterstroke to side with the deposed Ultraman. Whether Altman stays at Microsoft or returns to OpenAI, it will be good for Microsoft in terms of public opinion and interests. Altman returned to OpenAI, and almost all employees supported him. This is too rare in the history of Silicon Valley business. Altman continues to be CEO. On the surface, there is no change in his position. But employees support giving him strong informal power. The board of directors will also reassess Ultraman&#39;s value. Ultraman&#39;s mind must have reached a new level. Just like Sansa in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, she had ideals at the time, but after seeing through the nature of palace fighting, her personality and way of doing things changed dramatically.

Among the two new faces on the board of directors, Bret Taylor has not expressed much attitude towards AI supervision, but given that OpenAI employees asked him to join the board of directors in an open letter, Bret Taylor should not be a conservative. As a representative of right-wing economists, Larry Summers has always opposed excessive government regulation, and he cannot be a conservative.

873,"Published the headline article: &quot;OpenAI is always wary of Altman&quot; Sam Altman returns in style. On the evening of Tuesday, the 21st local time, OpenAI released big news on social platforms: Altmann returned to OpenAI and resumed his role as CEO, and the board of directors also underwent a major change. The new board of directors currently consists of three people, namely: Bret Taylor, who has served as an executive at Facebook, Twitter, and Salesforce, as chairman; Larry Summers, an American economist and former Treasury Secretary (Larry Summers); and Quora founder Adam D’Angelo, the only remaining old board member. Altmann remains as CEO but does not return to the board of directors. Along with him, Greg Brockman, the former chairman of OpenAI, who was kicked out by the old board of directors last Friday local time, also released a message on the X platform to confirm his return to OpenAI. But he only said &quot;backtocoding&quot; and did not say that he would return to the board of directors. At this point, with the exception of DeAngelo, all members of the old board of directors have been eliminated, and the new board of directors consists of three external directors and no internal directors from OpenAI. Before last Friday, OpenAI&#39;s original board of directors consisted of six people, three of whom were internal directors and three were external directors. On Friday, the old board of directors launched a &quot;surprise attack&quot; and suddenly kicked Altmann and Brockmann out of the board of directors and dismissed Altmann from his position as CEO, leaving only OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Suzkovi ( IIyaSutskever) one inside director and three outside directors. In the days since then, the story has frequently reversed. After experiencing employee turmoil, investor pressure, negotiations and negotiations breaking down, Altman and Brockman joining Microsoft, and 90% of employees signing a joint letter to &quot;force out the board of directors&quot;, Altman regained the CEO position and returned to OpenAI with Brockman. In that powerful joint letter, the signed employees gave the board of directors two choices: either bring Altman and Brockman back and replace the board of directors; or more than 700 of us leave and follow Altman to Microsoft. Obviously, the result of the new round of confrontation was that the employees succeeded in forcing the company to leave the company. Among them, new member of the board of directors, Brett Taylor, was also one of the newly nominated candidates. Altman and Brockman celebrated in a post on Obviously this is the best path for me and the team.&quot; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also sent his blessings. At this point in the story, this sensational &quot;infighting&quot; incident within a Silicon Valley star company seems to have ended with Altman&#39;s overwhelming victory. But is it really over? If you take a closer look, it is not difficult to find that all the new directors are ruthless, and the &quot;big bug&quot; in the company that drove Altman away has not yet been fixed. The question is, is this big BUG really a BUG? Artificial intelligence will obviously have a major impact on mankind in the future. Is it really right for artificial intelligence leaders like Altman to remove the sword hanging above their heads? OOpenAI is always wary of Altman.",263,-0.04873614626936481,0,4,269,6,5,3,0,1,3,2,100.0,"[0.9989507774847739, 0.010454663265533348, 0.2230831630774075, 0.13047255096715504, 0.4533685963464149, 0.5804749757249874, 0.5719596627167075, 0.7826653358894131, 0.9140319872267747, 0.5157402440062151, 0.7960834379671979, 0.11901253222741559, 0.5319321522934133, 0.33660816600323784, 0.2632981820072188, 0.7963965044667929, 0.1533134670050611, 0.2797145633429733, 0.5, 0.4737672181921908, 0.7737868954588227, 0.7529322366627671, 0.3893593868516769, 0.375, 0.48041194225474904, 0.34301855628142464, 0.6171296322284137, 0.6666666666666666, 0.3220001697847231, 0.4894901036168904, 0.8958931214833225, 0.38121739130434773, 0.7383502584041138, 0.028187378939195984, 0.6718697341519198, 0.5238135991818752, 0.40377415051395305, 0.2927206325928512, 0.4737672181921908, 0.7243246794292666, 0.9172178899384714, 0.5262327818078083, 0.6894109580969703, 0.5129654868751932, 0.9844357502720722, 0.08355056753460355, 0.6261572968657596, 0.5176464776778527, 0.9603487140980363, 0.9839161441536163, 0.7382501807664498, 0.83240889727678, 0.970288626805939, 0.5262327818078083, 0.5189115708408603, 0.7074366622177363, 0.35128545354177976, 0.05385589107892552, 0.5155861242046589, 0.5262327818078083, 0.12649526152913038, 0.9875663341599056, 0.46685837889694937, 0.8284371334780206, 0.7604222743090107, 0.7518753204048826]"

894,"Why did our country refuse to join Russia in smashing the &quot;US imperial system&quot;? Just from the perspective of industrial strategy: introducing foreign capital into China&#39;s leading companies in this field and competing with local companies as catfish is an important part of our industrial policy. For example, Apple was introduced in the smartphone field, Tesla was introduced in the electric vehicle field (and it was fully owned by the other party), and now Microsoft (openai) is introduced as a catfish in the AI field. Without the introduction of top foreign investment in the field of competition, it will be difficult for local companies to truly become stronger. This is also one of the important reasons why India, which likes to take advantage and is short-sighted, can hardly outperform China in industrial development. To sum up, our country is currently in the system built by the US imperialism and can still make profits, or at least the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This is why we have not raised the bar for the time being. At the same time, the current system has done more harm than good to American imperialism, at least in some areas. Therefore, the US imperialists began to overturn the situation locally. This is a very strange thing: China often maintains the existing system and international order (the U.S. imperial system), but it is the U.S. imperialism that destroys this system that it led and created back then.

900,"Use the Legend of Zhen Huan method to organize OpenAI’s revenge palace fight drama so that you can quickly replace the characters. Main characters: OpenAI’s former CEO Sam Altman (Zhen Huan) OpenAI’s former president Reg Brockman (Shen Meizhuang) OpenAI’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskvi (Queen) OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Mulati (concubine Jing) OpenAI independent director Adam DeAngelo (An Lingrong) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (fourth uncle) Twitch co-founder Emmett Hill (Ning Guiren) and the whole process OB’s Musk (King Guo) stated: In short, owners like Microsoft have “money but no power,” and the board of directors “has power but no money.” Before the incident, the board of directors consisted of six people: Zhen Huan, Shen Meizhuang, the Queen, and Qi Fei Anling Rongqi. Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang are radicals. They will engage in various financings to invent new products that will shock the world. The four queens and others are conservatives and are technology parties who are worried about the harm that AI development will cause to society. The text begins: -Without the court’s knowledge, the Harem Board of Directors suddenly announced the removal of Zhen Huan from her position as CEO because she was “always not candid in her communications with the Board of Directors, which hindered the Board’s ability to perform its duties.” Concubine Jing serves as interim CEO. At the same time, Shen Meizhuang was also kicked out of the board of directors in his absence. -Shen Meizhuang must be on the same front as Zhen Huan, so he took the initiative to resign. And consider creating another harem with Zhen Huan. -This inexplicable reason is puzzling to the whole world, and even Concubine Jing does not understand it. She, Concubine Duan, Xin Guiren and other senior executives asked the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan&#39;s status. -The queen is considered to be the leader of this palace change. At the same time, senior executives of Sannomiya and Liuyuan all received invitations to serve as interim CEOs, but they all declined. - After Zhen Huan was deposed, she returned to her home. Jin Xi, Huan Bi, Wen Shichu and Xiao Yunzi also followed. Even Concubine Jing and others also went to Zhen Huan&#39;s home to discuss returning to the harem. -The fourth master of the previous dynasty and others were angry when they learned about this. He put pressure on the board of directors and demanded that Zhen Huan be reinstated. It can also be seen here that no matter how independent the harem is, it cannot be without interference from the four uncles. -With the mediation of the Fourth Master, Zhen Huan returned to the harem as a &quot;visitor&quot; to negotiate with the board of directors, and Shen Meizhuang was also invited to join. But after talking for a day, Yushan sent round after round, but there was no result. - OB&#39;s Guojun Wang Rui commented on the matter. He believed that the board of directors must give a clear reason for taking such severe action. - Negotiations broke down. The queen announced that Zhen Huan would no longer serve as CEO, and the interim CEO was changed from Concubine Jing to Guiren Ning. It is said that the harem notified everyone to hold a meeting with Ning Guiren, but the reply received was a middle finger emoji, and only about ten people were present. -The Fourth Master spoke, and Zhen Huan Shen Meizhuang directly entered the court to lead a new harem. And anyone from the original harem can come if they want to join. -95% of the harem staff have signed a joint letter asking the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan to her position, otherwise they will all go to the new harem of the previous dynasty. Even the Queen signed it. - Rhythm master Jing Fei made an important statement: &quot;A harem without employees is nothing&quot;, triggering a large number of reposts. -The queen completely repented and said that she never wanted to harm the harem. Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang are all supportive. These three should have reconciled. -We are currently at a standstill. The prerequisite for Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang to return is that the board of directors must resign. The fourth uncle is very busy. He has already contacted Yu Shufang as an office space. He has also upgraded the hardware and welcomes hundreds of people to join at any time. -The board of directors began to consider mergers, but they were rejected. At present, the representative of the board of directors who is still insisting on his own opinion is An Lingrong. -Zhen Huanfang, Ning Guiren, and An Lingrong had another negotiation. Ning Guiren said that if there is no sufficient reason to remove Zhen Huan, then he will leave and not be willing to serve as interim CEO again. -Finally, Concubine Xi returned to the palace! Zhen Huan remains the CEO, and a new initial board of directors is established, including former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor (chairman of the board), former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and An Lingrong. -The fourth uncle expressed his satisfaction, let’s make dumplings and smash them together!

The board will be reorganized and members who oppose Altman will be removed. Microsoft previously announced that Altman would join the company. Personal comment: In the past five days, the news about OpenAI has been changing every day. On the first day, it was said that Altman had been fired. On the second day, it was said that Microsoft and other investors were pushing for Altman&#39;s return. On the third day, it was said that the return was blocked and the board of directors insisted on the original decision. On the fourth day, it was said that Altman was going to join Microsoft. At the same time, the OpenAI giant Most employees will resign en masse to follow Altman to Microsoft. At the same time, a final result will be reached today. Members of the board of directors who oppose Altman will be excluded. In the end, the board of directors, which apparently had control of OpenAI, still couldn&#39;t defeat Microsoft, which is the major shareholder. This is mainly because most employees have to resign en masse to follow Altman. This move is so lethal that Altman takes most of the company to Microsoft, and OpenAI is basically just a shell. son. This can be regarded as a relatively typical case of modern business war. After this battle, Microsoft will gain complete control of OpenAI. Previously, OpenAI was controlled by the board of directors, and Microsoft, as the majority shareholder, had no decision-making power. As a major shareholder, Microsoft supports Altman in promoting OpenAI to accelerate commercialization. The board of directors opposed this excessive commercialization because OpenAI had a peculiar &quot;non-profit&quot; structure in its early days, and the two sides had serious differences. Behind this disagreement, the main reason is that OpenAI has become more closed source and not open source enough after accelerating commercialization, which has hindered the accelerated development of AI technology. And in the past six months, the commercialization effect of ChatGPT has not been ideal, and the traffic has continued to decline, which finally led to this farce.

912,"The recent &quot;Gongdou Drama&quot; in which the founder of OpenAI resigned has once again shown us that balancing the interests of shareholders, employees, operators, boards of directors and users is not an easy task for any company. If you are not careful, , it may endanger the company&#39;s future development. These days I am just reviewing the two books &quot;From 0 to 1&quot; and &quot;The Difficulties of Starting a Business&quot;. The authors, Peter Thiel and Ben Horowitz, are both top venture capital tycoons in Silicon Valley. The book shares a lot of their experiences in entrepreneurship, investment and management. It is worth learning and referring to. I took the time to sort it out and share it with everyone. Technological innovation investment is the process of finding innovative companies with disruptive potential that are changing the existing industrial structure and business models. This investment approach focuses on technological innovation and model revolution, as they are expected to form a long-term moat by occupying a competitive advantage in the market. Ke Chuang 100 ETF (588190) has been in full swing recently. If we take it apart, we have to admit that investing in Ke Chuang 100 ETF (588190) requires extremely deep knowledge. For us ordinary people to succeed in the technological innovation investment paradigm, we must find a balance between winning rate and probability. Not only do the vast majority of retail investors not have enough capital to reach the threshold of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, but also because it is very difficult to select stocks on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, they also need to spend a lot of energy to improve their awareness. In this context, Science and Technology 100 ETF (588190) is a good tool that can match the three strategic emerging industries of medicine, technology and new energy with one click. At the same time, as highlighted in the aforementioned books, successful entrepreneurship and investing require a well-thought-out strategy, determination, and a spirit of continuous improvement. In the field of science and technology, innovation is the driving force for sustainable development, so we must have the courage to break through conventions and create new value. &quot;From 0 to 1&quot; Venture Capital 1. The biggest secret in venture capital is: the return on the best investment of a successful fund must be equal to or exceed the sum of all other investment objects. 2. Venture capitalists tend to spend more time on the companies with the most problems than on the most successful companies. 3. Now when I consider investing in a startup, I look at its founding team. Complementary technical skills and talents are important, but so is how well the founders understand each other and how well they work together. 4. Simply put, the value of a company today is the sum of the profits it will create in the future. (To correctly value a company, one must also convert future cash flows into today’s value, because the present value of the same amount of funds is more valuable than the period value.) Corporate development strategy 1. “Happy families are always similar, unhappy families are always alike. Families have their own misfortunes.” In business, the opposite is true. Businesses succeed for different reasons: each monopoly achieves monopoly status by solving a unique problem; but businesses fail for the same reason: they cannot escape competition. 2. Entrepreneurs often underestimate the significance of gradually developing the market. In fact, the market needs to be gradually expanded in a disciplined manner. The most successful companies first dominate a specific niche market and then expand into similar markets. Their entrepreneurial stories are similar, and they all gradually expand from their core business. 3. The combination of brand, scale, network effects and technology can create a monopoly company, but to make the company work, you need to carefully select the market and expand the scope carefully. 4. The perfect target market for a startup is a small, specific group of people with almost no other competitors. Any large market is a bad choice, and a large market where there are already other competitors is even worse. 5. A person with a clear goal will often choose the one thing that should be done most and concentrate on doing it well. Instead of working tirelessly only to become incompetent, it is better to work hard to cultivate strength in order to dominate. 6. It is better to be bold than mediocre and conservative; a bad plan is better than no plan; it is difficult to make money in a competitive market; marketing and product are equally important. 7. Competition causes us to overemphasize past opportunities and blindly repeat past patterns. 8. If you prioritize short-term growth, you&#39;ll miss the most important question: Will your company still be around in 10 years? Numbers alone can’t tell you the answer: you have to think hard about the essential characteristics of your company. Organizational Management 1. To find the reasons for disunity within the company, it is useful to distinguish the following three concepts: 1) Ownership: Who legally owns the company&#39;s assets? 2) Management rights: Who actually manages the day-to-day affairs of the company? 3) Control: Who formally manages the affairs of the company? 2. If someone is willing to have partial ownership of your company instead of a cash salary, it shows that they are willing to commit to increasing the value of the company in the long term. Stocks, while not the best way to motivate employees, are the best way for founders to keep the company together. 3. If you can explain why your company&#39;s mission is exciting, you&#39;ll attract the employees you need. 4. Time is the most valuable asset. It is not worth wasting time on people who cannot cooperate for a long time. If you can&#39;t build lasting relationships at work, you&#39;ve wasted your time—even from a purely financial perspective. 5. Defining roles can reduce conflicts. Most conflicts in the company are caused by colleagues competing for the same position. 6. The fewer people on the board of directors, the better. The smaller the board, the easier it is for directors to communicate, reach consensus, and provide effective oversight. However, this effectiveness means that in any conflict, a small board can oust management. That&#39;s why it&#39;s critical to choose your directors carefully: Every member of the board counts. A single problematic director can cause you misery and may even jeopardize the future of your company.

923,"[: Board members expressed different opinions] According to The Paper: OpenAI&#39;s &quot;coup drama&quot; that spanned five days and experienced reversals and reversals ended in an &quot;attempted coup&quot;. Silicon Valley, which was on the front line of &quot;eating melons&quot;, wasted no time in sleeping and eating. The masses may also finally get a good night&#39;s sleep. At midnight local time on November 21, the emerging American artificial intelligence giant OpenAI announced that it had reached an agreement in principle. Former CEO Sam Altman (Sam Altman) will return to the company as CEO, and &quot;form a team led by Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, Larry Summers and New Board of Directors composed of Adam D&#39;Angelo&quot;. The new board of directors only retains Quora CEO Adam D&#39;Angelo, and as some relevant people previously revealed, Bret Taylor, the former co-CEO of cloud software giant Salesforce and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will join OpenAI’s new board of directors. OpenAI pointed out in the statement that it is cooperating to discuss relevant details and thanks for your patience. Foreign media reported that according to relevant sources, the new small board of directors will review and appoint a board of directors of up to nine people, and the management of Ultraman and OpenAI have agreed to hire an external independent law firm. Conduct an investigation. Some netizens observed that, perhaps out of excitement, OpenAI directly called Ultraman &quot;Sam&quot; in the first version of the tweet, and then changed it to the full name of &quot;Ultraman Sam&quot; a few minutes later. On the OpenAI official website, as of press time, the first news on the homepage is still &quot;OpenAI announces management changes&quot; that started everything on the 17th. After the announcement was released, Altman quickly forwarded it with love and &quot;salute&quot; symbols, and posted: &quot;I love OpenAI, and everything I have done in the past few days has been to maintain the integrity of this team and its mission. When I When I made the decision to join Microsoft on Sunday night, it was clear that this choice was the best for me and the team. With the support of a new board of directors and Satya (Microsoft CEO), I look forward to returning to OpenAI and working with Microsoft on We will continue to develop on the basis of strong cooperation.&quot; Taylor, who is about to join the new board of directors, also retweeted OpenAI&#39;s announcement, while Summers&#39; last tweet was still from a week ago. Greg Brockman, former president of OpenAI, also quickly forwarded and commented: &quot;Amazing progress has been made today, and we will be stronger and more united than ever.&quot; Later, he also said: &quot;We are returning to OpenAI &amp; will start programming tonight.&quot; At nearly 2 a.m. local time, the excited Brockman posted another photo with OpenAI employees: &quot;We are finally back.&quot; Later, the official OpenAI account also forwarded it This photo is accompanied by the most classic sentence in the company&#39;s current turmoil: &quot;OpenAI is nothing without employees.&quot; Microsoft CEO Satya, who once offered an &quot;olive branch&quot; to Altman and Brockman Satya Nadella did not repost OpenAI’s announcement, but retweeted Altman’s tweet, expressing satisfaction with the result: “We are excited about the changes in OpenAI’s board of directors. We believe this is a path to a more stable and wealthy company. Insightful and effective management is a critical step. Sam, Greg, and I have discussed and agreed that they have important roles on the OpenAI leadership team to work together to ensure that OpenAI continues to thrive and carry forward its mission. We look forward to this strong collaboration &quot;Basically, provide customers and partners with the value of next-generation AI.&quot; Previously, Nadella has publicly stated that he will provide support for Ultraman, no matter where he ends up choosing. Some analysts have said that the turmoil in OpenAI will definitely have a negative impact on Microsoft, as the largest shareholder and partner, and after that, Microsoft is likely to take the opportunity to fight for a board seat. The two interim CEOs who were successively promoted by the board of directors in the past five days also responded positively to the matter. Among them, Mira Murati, the first interim CEO and chief technology officer, quickly forwarded OpenAI’s announcement and attached a blue heart symbol. Previously, it was reported that Mulati had been working hard to bring Altman and Brockman back to the company during his tenure as interim CEO. After Nadella invited Altman and others to join Microsoft on November 20, she, like many other executives who supported Altman, tweeted that &quot;OpenAI is nothing without employees.&quot; Some analysts also said that if Altman and Brockman join Microsoft, Mulati is likely to follow them to change jobs. Regardless of his true feelings in his heart, Emmett Shear, the second interim CEO to be brought on board by the board of directors and the former CEO of Amazon’s live game streaming platform Twitch, also expressed satisfaction with the result: “When I joined OpenAI , I&#39;m not sure what the right path is. This path will maximize safety while also being responsible to all stakeholders. I&#39;m happy to be part of the solution.&quot; In the comment area, some netizens complained &quot;Early You should broadcast your meeting live on Twitch.&quot; Some netizens &quot;comforted&quot; him: &quot;You can write that you were the CEO of OpenAI on your resume in the future.&quot; A person familiar with the matter revealed to foreign media that during the negotiations with OpenAI, Sher&#39;s Joining was a big turning point. After the dust settled, the happiest people were naturally the OpenAI employees and external investors who supported Ultraman&#39;s return. They could finally spend the next Thanksgiving holiday without any burden. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital said Ultraman&#39;s return &quot;is the best outcome for the company, its employees, those building on their technology and the world at large.&quot; On the other hand, for the four board members who dismissed Altman at the time, this result must not have been what they were happy to see. Ilya Sutskever, the chief scientist of OpenAI who had &quot;rebelled&quot; to Ultraman&#39;s side during the process, only forwarded some relevant content on X and did not express his position. Quora CEO Adam D&#39;Angelo, who will be &quot;retained&quot;, only forwarded the announcement, and the content of technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley&#39;s X account is not disclosed to the public. In addition, Helen Toner, who is suspected by some analysts to be a key figure in the operation to remove Ultraman, only wrote one sentence when forwarding OpenAI&#39;s announcement: &quot;Now, we can all have a sleep.&quot; As for OpenAI As for Microsoft&#39;s competitors and other &quot;melon-eating&quot; people, everyone feels reassured and exhausted by this reversal of the ending, and they are also more curious about how OpenAI, whose reputation has been damaged, will develop next. Elon Musk, who has always been &quot;venomous&quot;, naturally did not give up the opportunity to comment. Ten minutes after the announcement of OpenAI, he wrote on X: &quot;What a complicated web we have weaved.&quot; This sentence is very It may be a reference to the poem &quot;Marmion&quot; by Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott, which reads: &quot;Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when once we When the deception begins.” Later, Musk responded with laughing and crying emojis to comments from netizens complaining that OpenAI was “still a terrible board of directors” and “can’t wait to watch Season 2.” Under the comment &quot;This is like telling you at the end of the movie that everything was just a dream&quot;, Musk wrote: &quot;Compared with merging with Microsoft, it should be better for the world if OpenAI can maintain (semi-)autonomy. Power is It’s a little scattered.” It is worth noting that the OpenAI controversy was almost entirely broadcast live on Musk’s X platform, and all participants regarded it as an important public expression platform. Perhaps this is important for the X platform It is also the best &quot;free advertising&quot;.

Reflecting on the current situation, founders should do the following: 1. Founders must have absolute control over the company. OpenAI is still a relatively ideal company. Sam, like Jobs and Musk, is a maverick. He has created a maverick corporate structure for OpenAI. Their highest authority is the board of directors, which is non-profit. OpenAlNonprofit has complete control. The company that launched GPT was only a for-profit subsidiary controlled by him, paving the way for his dismissal. 2. Team unity is particularly important. Infighting is the biggest hidden danger of a company. No matter what angle you look at this incident, it is a problem within the company, which is not united and unified. Many people speculate that this was started by chief scientist Ilya leading three non-employee directors. Therefore, for entrepreneurs, building a good team is very important and is the most basic guarantee of success. 3. Fully coordinate with stakeholders. After this incident, various interest groups later had disagreements. As a result, conflicts intensified due to mutual games in the later period. Sam&#39;s maverick personality determined that he was not capable enough in this area. The &quot;danger&quot; of OpenAI is Microsoft&#39;s &quot;machine&quot;. Previously, Microsoft was only a tenant of OpenAI, not the owner. Cooperation with OpenAI has become a sword hanging over Microsoft&#39;s head. The more OpenAI advances, the more dangerous Microsoft becomes. However, generative AI is too important to Microsoft. Not only has it invested heavily in OpenAI, but it has also embedded large GPT models in most of its products. There are gaps and rifts within OpenAI, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Microsoft.",270,-0.06406764192531833,3,4,266,19,3,0,0,0,5,1,100.0,"[0.9999805411413988, 0.9850771017556544, 0.9944332349297061, 0.7231409465381605, 0.7418509550632074, 0.2456853637348797, 0.5488180064031624, 0.989013935655506, 0.06995985210836686, 0.3020707298823372, 0.9296959368181477, 0.9031095236992194, 0.4745330337193969, 0.4891003793952503, 0.48110883347454536, 0.27146839371354003, 0.8317800073381955, 0.8537547346761496, 0.7637148048655201, 0.8234833943056747, 0.3936164837541357, 0.9020203733731897, 0.21554050975859873, 0.7771091131835387, 0.9913663924945543, 0.5475474902050657, 0.3240895098150135, 0.7289090182868005, 0.9699394411004465, 0.9911212719050828, 0.6257117801445921, 0.8267996560175739, 0.19965937628724828, 0.7315703797721197, 0.38242033034495526, 0.5951503517710258, 0.7319714907869384, 0.2961077743620437, 0.2605728570431949, 0.99291224977208, 0.5262327818078083, 0.36572569315150527, 0.5138381015060628, 0.48589515407799766, 0.5048322122337593, 0.4979120343555751, 0.9132960998587846, 0.993052637211118, 0.9997530735589654, 0.7530263533678441, 0.10937884739830106, 0.612718738264278, 0.30997856486729314, 0.6277875116892989, 0.8990756454428565, 0.7449747833641895, 0.8447733843369465, 0.9311269406738761, 0.016662541662615826, 0.93900294077739]"

954,"It took 12 years for Steve Jobs to return to Apple, but it only took 5 days for Altman to return to OpenAI. Let me highlight three points: Left point: the drama of a quick reversal. Altman&#39;s story is like a roller coaster, from being fired to announcing his joining Microsoft, and finally returning to the position of CEO of OpenAI, demonstrating the power of rapid change and decision-making in modern enterprises. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand, the world is changing fast, too fast. When Ultraman joined Microsoft, I was still sighing sadly: Will he join a big factory at the end of the universe? Now that we are returning, it seems we still have to believe and have light. Right point: This palace battle of OpenAI is a battle between conservative and radical artificial intelligence. The Ilias are conservatives, and what they want is an &quot;AI paradise&quot; that is almost free of &quot;commercial sludge&quot;; the Ultramans are radicals, and what they want is a sustainable commercial company. On this premise We must take into account the vision of benefiting mankind in an appropriate manner. Facts have proved that development is the last word. Incidentally, Altman&#39;s reinstatement highlights the influence employees have in modern corporate decision-making. OpenAI employees threatened to resign collectively to express their support for Altman, which was unimaginable in the era of Steve Jobs. Next point: the close connection between the founder and the fate of the business. Both Jobs and Altman attest to the tremendous influence founders have on corporate culture and innovation direction. Their return is not only a personal victory, but also symbolizes a major shift in corporate strategy and development direction. Although these two stories take place in different eras, they both tell the truth about the close relationship between founders and the fate of their companies. I have a small rule when buying stocks. I never buy a company whose founder is not the CEO. In fact, it is for a similar reason. In the past few days, I have been watching this OpenAI palace battle scene every day. At first I thought it was a little monster fighting Ultraman, episode after episode.

965,"Let me sort out OpenAI’s revenge palace drama using the legend of Zhen Huan, so that you can quickly substitute the characters. Main characters: OpenAI’s former CEO Sam Altman (Zhen Huan) OpenAI’s former president Reg Brockman (Shen Meizhuang) OpenAI’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskvi (Queen) OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Mulati (concubine Jing) OpenAI independent director Adam DeAngelo (An Lingrong) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (fourth uncle) Twitch co-founder Emmett Hill (Ning Guiren) and the whole process OB’s Musk (King Guojun) please: You can see the specific composition of OpenAI in our video: I won’t go into details here. In short, the owners like Microsoft are &quot;rich but not powerful&quot; and the board of directors are &quot;powerful but not rich&quot;. Before the incident, the board of directors consisted of six people: Zhen Huan, Shen Meizhuang, the Queen, and Qi Fei Anling Rongqi. Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang are radicals. They will engage in various financings to invent new products that will shock the world. The four queens and others are conservatives and are technology parties who are worried about the harm that AI development will cause to society. The text begins: -Without the court’s knowledge, the Harem Board of Directors suddenly announced the removal of Zhen Huan from her position as CEO because she was “always not candid in her communications with the Board of Directors, which hindered the Board’s ability to perform its duties.” Concubine Jing serves as interim CEO. At the same time, Shen Meizhuang was also kicked out of the board of directors in his absence. -Shen Meizhuang must be on the same front as Zhen Huan, so he took the initiative to resign. And he is considering creating another harem with Zhen Huan. -This inexplicable reason is puzzling to the whole world, and even Concubine Jing does not understand it. She, Concubine Duan, Xin Guiren and other senior executives asked the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan&#39;s status. -The queen is considered to be the leader of this palace change. At the same time, senior executives of Sannomiya and Liuyuan all received invitations to serve as interim CEOs, but they all declined. - After Zhen Huan was deposed, she returned to her home. Jin Xi, Huan Bi, Wen Shichu and Xiao Yunzi also followed. Even Concubine Jing and others also went to Zhen Huan&#39;s home to discuss returning to the harem. -The fourth master of the previous dynasty and others were angry when they learned about this. He tried to put pressure on the board of directors and demanded that Zhen Huan be reinstated. It can also be seen here that no matter how independent the harem is, it cannot be without interference from the four uncles. -With the mediation of the Fourth Master, Zhen Huan returned to the harem as a &quot;visitor&quot; to negotiate with the board of directors, and Shen Meizhuang was also invited to join. But after talking for a day, Yushan sent round after round, but there was no result. - OB&#39;s Guojun Wang Rui commented on the matter. He believed that the board of directors must give a clear reason for taking such severe action. - Negotiations broke down. The queen announced that Zhen Huan would no longer serve as CEO, and the interim CEO was changed from Concubine Jing to Guiren Ning. It is said that the harem notified everyone to hold a meeting with Ning Guiren, but the reply received was a middle finger emoji, and only about ten people were present. -The Fourth Master spoke, and Zhen Huan Shen Meizhuang directly entered the court to lead a new harem. And anyone from the original harem can come if they want to join. -95% of the harem staff have signed a joint letter asking the board of directors to resign and restore Zhen Huan to her position, otherwise they will all go to the new harem of the previous dynasty. Even the Queen signed it. - Rhythm master Jing Fei made an important statement: &quot;A harem without employees is nothing&quot;, triggering a large number of reposts. -The queen completely repented and said that she never wanted to harm the harem. Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang are all supportive. These three should have reconciled. -We are currently at a standstill. The prerequisite for Zhen Huan and Shen Meizhuang to return is that the board of directors must resign. The fourth uncle is very busy. He has already contacted Yu Shufang as an office space. He has also upgraded the hardware and welcomes hundreds of people to join at any time. -The board of directors began to consider mergers, but they were rejected. At present, the representative of the board of directors who is still insisting on his own opinion is An Lingrong. -Zhen Huanfang, Ning Guiren, and An Lingrong had another negotiation. Ning Guiren said that if there is no sufficient reason to remove Zhen Huan, then he will leave and not be willing to serve as interim CEO again. -Finally, Concubine Xi returned to the palace! Zhen Huan remains the CEO, and a new initial board of directors is established, including former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor (chairman of the board), former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and An Lingrong. -The fourth uncle expressed his satisfaction, let’s make dumplings and smash them together!

On November 20, Microsoft CEO and Chairman Satya Nadella issued a statement stating that Sam Altman, Greg Brockman (Greg Brockman) and their colleagues will join Microsoft to lead a new advanced artificial intelligence research team. Coming out of a small town, he studied at Harvard and MIT, dropped out of school to start a business, and served as the CTO of the Internet payment processing platform Stripe. Brockman&#39;s life resume is legendary. In 2008, Brockman entered Harvard to study mathematics and computer science, but when he realized that he could no longer learn more knowledge, he chose to drop out. In 2010, he transferred to MIT to study computer science. But he didn’t stay at MIT for long, and the idea of starting a business began to sprout in his mind. In 2010, after &quot;graduating&quot; from college, Brockman joined the startup Stripe. In May 2015, he left Stripe and began working on independent artificial intelligence projects. After working at Stripe for 5 years, Brockman realized that &quot;AI&quot; was the field he really wanted to devote his life to. After leading Stripe on the right track, he chose to leave. In the same year, Elon Musk, Altman, Brockman and others initiated the establishment of OpenAI to promote the development of artificial intelligence technology. Brockman told Altman his idea of setting up an artificial intelligence company, and the two had similar views. For them, OpenAI was just a somewhat &quot;unrealistic&quot; idea at the time, but soon, a dinner hosted by Altman at SandHill Road created a top team and allowed the idea to be truly implemented.

Its biggest problem now is not the ban on sales in China, but that even big customers like OpenAI can&#39;t afford cards. OpenAI spent 6 billion US dollars to buy cards this year, but its computing power is still seriously insufficient. If it wants to develop GPT5, spending another 6 billion may not be enough. And OpenAI has publicly stated that it has no money. I don’t know how big this change is and how big this matter is. relation. So will Microsoft continue to be the sugar daddy? Office looks a little smarter, but originally this product had no competing products, and the share of browsers and search engines that Microsoft most wanted to break through has actually declined. The market has long been flooded with news of GPT5 stagnation. This round of AI bubble has surpassed the 2000 dot-com bubble, which is actually the product of the largest release of water in history.

1049,"Unexpectedly, I, Ultraman, am back! On the afternoon of November 22, OpenAI announced that it had reached an agreement in principle, and Altman returned to the company as CEO. Ultraman himself and Microsoft have also issued documents confirming this matter. What is going on in this repetitive business farce? To put it simply, the board of directors, which had already had differences with Altman, took advantage of his participation in the APEC meeting to dismiss him at the speed of light. After being kicked out, Ultraman turned around and found Microsoft, the boss behind the scenes. He came up with Lian Wu Kangcao and kicked out the board of directors. So is this a good thing? Not necessarily. When openAI was founded, it was a non-profit company. The core founders and engineers were students of famous American artificial intelligence experts. Student entrepreneurship is always full of idealism. But ideals alone cannot fill your stomach. Altman proposed the concept of a gpt store, which is similar to the Android and Apple app malls. Developers can use openAI technology to develop applications, put them on the shelves for sale, and then obtain revenue sharing. This situation made other people on the board of directors unable to sit still. They agreed to develop an open source AI together to benefit the world, but now you just want to make a fortune. The conflict between the two sides was very fierce. In addition to internal differences, there is actually pressure from the outside of OpenAI, which comes from Microsoft, which invested $12 billion in it. One of the agreements between the two parties requires OpenAI to exclusively use Microsoft Azure cloud services. When the cumulative profit reaches 150 billion US dollars, Microsoft will sell all its shares and turn OpenAI into a complete public welfare institution. Chatgpt’s current monthly revenue is about US$100 million. Even if it increases tenfold, it will take more than 10 years to pay off this debt of gratitude. This time is enough for Microsoft to use AI to rebuild its own intelligent network ecosystem. In order not to become a puppet of a large company, openAI came up with a way to open its own API interface, bypass Microsoft as much as possible, and directly contact customers to increase profits. This also made Microsoft very unhappy. So we will see Ultraman immediately defect to Microsoft after he is out, and the profits will be more attractive to ordinary employees. This farce is probably still a cliché story of capital defeating ideals.

1098,"I adopted an abandoned little orange cat. There was a family in the community who moved and abandoned a little orange cat, which was very dear to them. I have seen too many abuses of cats recently. Children in the community kicked and bullied him. I was afraid that the cat would be hurt outside, so I took him home with my friends. I went to the hospital for a physical examination, deworming, and the iconcon vaccine. Fortunately, I&#39;m relatively healthy! I don’t know if raising a cat depends on your taste. When my friend’s cat food arrived, he was really eating it. It seemed that he was very hungry. He touched it with the bag. At first, he was still protecting the food, but then he ate it. After a few minutes, it didn&#39;t respond when I touched it again. I took it home and ordered cat food, cat supplies and cat toys from the Internet. I almost bought everything I needed to buy, cooked rice, and gave it to the little one again. The cat put some egg icons, meat and vegetables in it. It wolfed down the food. After half a month of raising it, it became fatter than before. It looked meaty. The more I looked at it, the more I liked it. Later I found that it had a bad mouth and started to eat it again. I made a guide online and bought a pet-specific Spiri functional cream to prevent cat dental calculus and plaque. After eating it for a week, my mouth no longer smells so bad. It has a light cat food taste and is very convenient to eat once a day. You also don’t need to brush your teeth, which saves time and effort. I appeal to everyone not to abandon cats!!! Don’t abandon any pets!!! Before raising a cat, you must think clearly whether you can always take responsibility. Cats are part of the family and cannot be abandoned at any time.

Review of the script killing story: About the woman wearing a skirt: Dare’s true identity is a veterinarian and a staff member of an animal protection center. The skirt she is wearing is Pink, but gray and yellow in different views of cats and dogs. When Ahushi came to this city, he rescued Ahushi, but because Ahushi saw the cat abuse in the video and heard the content of the woman&#39;s phone call, he mistakenly thought that the woman was a bad person. But the woman wanted to use this method to lure Brother Quan out and punish the bad guys, so she said that she wanted to join Brother Quan in abusing the cat. Later, when everyone was locked up together, she also heard the woman say that it was her birthday, It failed last time. The reasons why everyone came here are: Tuantuan: picked up by a woman in a skirt. Mina: Rescued by a Woman in a Skirt Wei Guozheng and Ahu were both sent by nearby patrol police after they were anesthetized due to a car accident. And notified Wei Yuan to pick up Wei Guozheng. Li Pingan: The woman in the skirt picked it up and notified Ranran to pick it up. Qiao Lin: Because my rescuer was hit by a car when I blocked him in front of him while crossing the road, I came here for surgery. The owner of the canteen is an orange cat, so he always takes naps and sleeps at the counter instead of working. In the afternoon, I will go out for a walk by myself. But because he was fat, he was targeted by traffickers and taken away. After being taken away, he was used as a blood cat to supply blood. But the boss found a chance to run away, but due to physical reasons and getting lost, the boss couldn&#39;t find his home and became a homeless man. Later, the boss felt...?

After finishing the adventure, I really don’t know what to say, as anything I say may be a spoiler. Let’s talk about the experience. The first one is not big, but we finished it in three hours. Second, there was an hour of review and immersion in the plot, so I cried for a full hour. I cried like a storm. I was so moved. Third, the reasoning part is a little difficult, and hardcore players can play it. In general, I was still listening to the review, so I cried and gave it a five-star backhand.

Netizen Lemon Tea (pseudonym) was one of the people who broke the news that &quot;many celebrities were &#39;unboxed&#39; for opposing cat abuse.&quot; She said that someone recently exposed her personal information and that of her family and friends, and since then she has received many harassing phone calls and even threatening letters. The incident occurred because she had exposed bad comments in the group chat. The screenshot shows that someone in the chat history claimed to be a &quot;Sunba&quot; bar friend. Lemon Tea said that the group chat had been searched for the personal information of many citizens and published on the Internet. After being harassed, she called the police and received a reply.

As soon as I came back, I received a screenshot of Lao Tie&#39;s WeChat. It was said that someone in our community saw a cat locked in a car. One of the cat&#39;s legs looked injured and it was very thin. It had been locked in the car for a day and a night. The group said that the property management company had already contacted the cat, and the cat was still locked up and barking in the car. It was suspected of being abused, etc... Then Lao Tie became anxious and asked me to rescue the cat. It was late at night, and I said I didn’t dare to go, and I couldn’t drive their car. Lao Tie also gave online instructions: Teach me how to open the sunroof, how to drive the window, and taught me hard. I still didn’t dare, so I said I would call the police. People who think about torturing cats are not in their right mind. It’s a dark and windy night and I have to put safety first! Lao Tie was afraid that the police would think it was a trivial matter, so he finally said: &quot;If he were at home, he would try to pry the car.&quot; Do you still remember that I posted on Weibo about a police officer in our area? He came to me on his bike late at night to tell me about telecommunications fraud. During the epidemic, he joined the policeman from the district who worked the night shift and ate instant noodles every day. It was him again, I contacted him the night before. I was also very uneasy, and I was afraid that it would be a trivial matter.

The female protagonist is really tolerant of him! He worked too hard during the war, and it felt like he would be full of diseases when he got old. Some descriptions make me feel a bit outrageous. For example, the male protagonist has no time to spare and loves to tease cats and dogs. He will not let go of cats passing by when he is bored. The original text uses the word &quot;cat abuse&quot; and it is written twice. Specifically, what kind of nue method is it? It should be... not very cruel, maybe just teasing? There is also a place where the enemy sneaked into their rear and captured a villager (probably like this). Everyone discussed countermeasures. The male protagonist was very calm and felt that they were all too anxious. As a result, he heard that the female protagonist was also arrested.

I raised a blue cat, but I stayed up one night and soon gave birth to a litter. Then I gave birth to a kitten. I gave it to her. I gave it a name, but one day I saw it being taken away by an uncle. I was afraid that someone who abuses cats would take it away, but it came back on the fourth day with the smell of fried cakes. I don’t know who was kind. The uncle took it home and raised it for a few days, and it ran back on its own. Then it went back to the pastoral area with me twice. The second time I went back, it ran away and got lost on the first day. I waited for four or five days and didn&#39;t come back. It was a month ago. I promised to give one. When my brother came, I couldn&#39;t bear to let the kitten stay with me for a few days, and then I couldn&#39;t get along with my brother, so he stayed with me all the time. My brother&#39;s home in the pastoral area is about forty or fifty kilometers away from my home. As a result, today my brother&#39;s mother came from After You Qi returned home to the pastoral area, he found a kitten squatting at the door of their house, opened the door, went in, and rubbed his aunt&#39;s trousers. Before, the kitten and I went to the depths of the desert for a month. The tourist Rua&#39;s super-good aunt sent me a photo. My brother forwarded it to me. It looked like my kitten. Although it was dirty, I don&#39;t know what the fate was. The distance between my brother and our house is quite far for the kitten, and there are so many houses in between. How could he find their home so accurately? Another thing is that my blue cat is the kitten’s mother. The cat has been extra clingy since it was no longer in the store. I used to chase it rua, and now it chases me. When I go to the bathroom, it comes and lies with me while I give people a manicure. There is no space on the table, so it lies with me. It also goes to bed with me when I sleep, so the little animals are really cute and distressed. Now that they have come to our house, I will give you the best love. So tomorrow, aunt will take another clear photo and send it to me. I don’t know if it’s a kitten, but looking at the photo, I’m probably 95% sure it’s my kitten. It might have been born to go to my brother’s house. 2 Alxa·Badain Jaran Town close d",205,-0.01696009800395574,2,2,199,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,100.0,"[0.9999680719302814, 1.0]"

But the later part is not very...well...not very good. It even makes me feel like I am watching the animation works that Jun Asa has participated in in recent years. It is not very good...it has good and bad qualities. , anyway, the overall style that is really good in the middle is still Isaka’s style. I don’t know whether this is a compliment or a derogation.

1215,"Is it my misunderstanding? I always feel that there are quite a lot of sisters with backstabbing voices on the 9 side, but there are a lot less on the 57 side... It may also be that 57 has sexualized female characters for too long and boiled frogs in warm water. Putting this aside, 57 There are actually not too many men in her background. Although it can be seen from the copy that Guotie has some awareness of loving women, she also loves men. Now the overall trend of 57 is towards butter, and this must be the main planner of the game. (Male) Determined, including the increasingly forced ML plot. Even if the writing style is as good as pot stickers, it is impossible to write the ML in a natural way every time, and it is obvious that the plot of the ML is written for otakus. I have always wondered how Guotie could still love men when he has worked with these male colleagues and has the most direct understanding of the needs of otakus. I have always believed that anyone who really loves women cannot love men. Would a person who loves cats love someone who abuses cats? Will a patriotic person love the Japanese? Lei Wen&#39;s activities are so fragmented, and the pot stickers are also fragmented in my opinion. Including previous rumors that the internal copywriters of the 57 project team have a great say, but now it seems that this is not the case. The copywriters will eventually have to give in to Mei Zhai and ML, and even the artists who produce based on the copywriting have no say. As for the screenwriter foreman of 9, I think she doesn’t love men as much as Guo Tie. At least she has a more indifferent attitude towards men. However, there are many people in the copywriting team, and it is impossible to determine which ones are her will and which ones are not. But no matter which one it is, no matter what the status of these two female screenwriters in the project, the final result is that Lily was stabbed in the back again, just like Principal Zhang Guimei&#39;s movie, the backstabbing was very thorough.

1271,"Cat adoption in Xi’an is free! Description of the situation: *Breed: British shorthair cat calico*Gender: Female kitten I bought it, it&#39;s been well maintained, and it&#39;s probably been vaccinated. *Deworming: There were no parasites when it was first picked up. It should have been dewormed before wandering. As soon as I picked it up, I used Big Pet to deworm it. *The process and basic situation of picking up the cat: The kitten was picked up in the garden of the community on October 15th. It seemed like a close relative when we first met it. I guess it had just been wandering for a few days. Its body was very clean, without parasites or ear mites. There was a trauma at the corner of the left eye. It was probably caused by an infection caused by not being treated while wandering. After a period of treatment, the trauma at the corner of the eye has now healed. The kitten was in good health and was taken to the pet hospital for a simple examination and found no symptoms. The kitten has a very affectionate personality and won&#39;t be scratched. It doesn&#39;t resist when it comes to cutting nails, cleaning ears, applying medicine to wounds, taking oral medicine, etc. It especially likes to nuzzle and cling to people, and has a very good personality. The cat picker already has several big cats at home. Due to the situation at home, he is unable to adopt them, so the kittens are currently placed at a friend&#39;s home. *Special note: I’m not sure what the kitten has experienced before. The kitten will howl when it can’t see people, which is quite unpleasant. After a few weeks of adoption, the situation has eased. I guess it may be a sign of a lack of security after being abandoned. , I went to the hospital for a checkup, and the doctor said it was not caused by illness. Kittens will use cat litter themselves, but it may be that the range of activities in the temporary cage is too small, making it easy for the kitten to step on the litter. It is recommended to use a large litter box with sufficient space. Kittens are so dear and have very good personalities. Domestic breed cats have no ability to survive outside. If they are abandoned, they will never survive the weather in Xi&#39;an! I hope someone with good intentions can give the kitten a home! *Adoption requirements: 1. There must be no cat abuse! 2. Must be a caring, patient, cat-loving adopter 3. No fees will be charged, just hope that the kittens can find a good home 4. Only self-pickup in Xi&#39;an city is accepted 5. Students are not accepted for adoption 6 .It is best to adopt an adopter who has experience in raising cats. The kitten is very beautiful and has a very good personality. I hope it can find a warm home!

1295,"That night, I really felt that this friend had been deeply in love and had too many expectations. Even if I didn’t understand how painful it was to be “under the spotlight and not recognize you in an audience of thousands of people”, even if I felt that way at the time. At least I know some of the untrue parts of the submission, and I&#39;m trying to understand them. I have always felt that chasing stars is a very personal experience to a certain extent, and everyone must have their own considerations. So although it is difficult to empathize, we all feel that since we were loved, hugged, and illuminated by Huang Lizhi together, it is considered a fate. If you are not happy, just vent it out and then hug someone else. But tens of thousands of scoldings were left behind that denied all Huang Lizhi’s efforts and sincerity. After getting the sympathy he wanted and heroic detachment, after half a year, he got a video and wonderful tragedy from two months ago. Literature came out and she was attacked by the set fire again. At that time, I really wanted to ask why it was so painful to chase after that time. How many words and types of curses do you want to judge Huang Lizhi this time? After venting this time, can you really let yourself and Huang Lizhi go? Not to mention it&#39;s all based on lies. Some people want to be remembered by her, some want to remember her, or want to remember themselves when they liked her. Some people don&#39;t need anything. They just want to be happy now. If they are not so happy, they won&#39;t watch it. Chasing stars is such a simple relationship, and we have control over the beginning and end. Huang Lizhi himself has said sorry countless times for not being able to make everyone happy. No matter how good she is, she is definitely not objectively perfect. Please never take it for granted that she should catch everything.

1316,"It is more difficult for dogs than cats here, because cats can also catch mice or be fed by people, but stray dogs are really driven away wherever they go, and many dogs have children before they are even born... The life span of stray cats is about After two to three years, a stray dog will be very good even if it lasts for one year. Because stray dogs can only rely on garbage, but now the trash cans are made very high, and there is no place for stray dogs to eat. Unless you meet a more conscientious restaurant owner who will feed you some food. Therefore, stray dogs are very, very thin. Except for kittens, all adult cats are actually very fat and strong. (Except for the calico cat, the rest of the cats I feed are not thin. The orange cat can be called very fat. ) and stray cats escape very quickly, so cat abusers specialize in catching smaller cats, because malnutrition causes them to escape slowly. I have always wanted to feed stray dogs, because stray dogs are more pitiful than stray cats, but stray dogs are more afraid of people than stray cats. A stray orange cat (it can even be called a wild cat, its mother was abandoned, and it was born completely in the grass) dares to stand next to me waiting for me to feed it, but stray dogs even if I feed them Freeze-dried fish, when they see me, they have to make sure I&#39;m five or six meters away from them before they dare to eat it. Others think that stray dogs hurt people, but in fact, it is free-range domestic dogs that bite people. Most stray dogs are afraid of people and want to please people, but free-range domestic dogs are very vicious. Most of the free-range dog owners don’t love dogs. Once they find out that their dog has bitten someone, they will lie and say that they have never had a dog, so their dog becomes an unwanted stray dog... What really needs to be dealt with is the person. , I think the dog should be microchipped to determine who the dog owner is. There will be severe fines for abandonment and fines for not keeping the leash. Only in this way can we fundamentally prevent the increase in stray dogs.

1338,"I hope &quot;Today&#39;s Cute Dog&quot; will be aired normally next week! I watched episode 5.6 today, which also talks about school bullying. Ironically, Jianan High School (the school where the incident occurred) happened to be rated as a &quot;bullying-free high school&quot; and a banner was posted. The perpetrator happened to be jealous, so he teamed up with his classmates who were doing well to bully the victim. As for why there are less themes related to campus bullying in Chinese movies and TV dramas, I personally guess that one is that campus bullying in my country is indeed not as common as in South Korea, and the other is censorship restrictions. However, we have a large population, so there are quite a few cases of bullying on campus - because I was also a victim. The perpetrators of campus bullying are usually too idle and have a bad heart, so they take out their frustrations on others - similar to those who abuse cats and dogs. In the play, fortunately, the victimized classmates met a responsible teacher like the male protagonist (the male protagonist also suffered from campus bullying when he was a teenager, so he can empathize with it). As for me, my class teacher in the second year of high school was relatively young, and I only gave them ideological education verbally, but the effect was of course very little, and even deepened their resentment towards me (a resentment that came out of nowhere); in the third year of high school, because I was affected to sleep, I slept with another person. The girls in the class formed a dispute. Our head teacher (more than fifty?) solved the problem very neatly. So I am very grateful to this teacher. In your own life, you are the protagonist. Only by living your own life well can you live up to yourself. For other unhappy things, let them gather dust in the corner!

1344,"A stray Fold-ear was picked up in a Chongqing adoption community. It was dirty and covered with fleas. After I touched it, it followed me to the elevator and went home. Because I was afraid that it would not survive in the wild, I let it live at home. On the third day, I took him to the hospital for a checkup, a CT scan, deworming, and a bath. The doctor said he was in good health except for being starved for too long and suffering from malnutrition. Now I am eating great and gaining a lot of weight. I have never raised a cat myself. I originally wanted to keep it at home for a few days and then send it back after finding its owner. But now it seems that it was abandoned. I also thought about raising it myself, but I am too busy at work now and I can’t give it a new one. I have a lot of companionship, and I am allergic to cat hair. I hope that a suitable owner can adopt it and give it a better life. The cat has a super good personality, is quiet, doesn&#39;t know how to parkour at night, and can use cat litter. Adoption requires a deposit of 500, which will be refunded after one year. It is not for the purpose of making money. After picking it up, it cost more than 1,000 just to check for insects and fleas. As a threshold for adoption, I am afraid of encountering cat abusers, and I don’t want you to do it just because of a whim. Adoption cannot be responsible for cats. Adoption conditions: 1️⃣Have raised cats, feed them scientifically, understand folded ears, seek medical treatment in case of illness, and will not abandon them 2️⃣Seal the windows 3️⃣Have a stable residence and job 4️⃣Family consent 5️⃣Neuter and close d",152,-0.11193571238639283,2,2,152,8,1,0,0,0,3,0,0.0157,"[0.25908337730938746, 0.009183475909370298, 0.4495062028520185, 0.8010802093392664, 0.7840554641449305, 0.37291560173480665, 0.4521372679839911, 0.5, 0.2907348242811503, 0.6383291635313675, 0.9510903573465374, 0.37086473932023467, 0.49387453652981717, 0.7499999999999999, 0.6906239540497272, 0.1381807848139287, 0.8353767062165496, 0.129374071860488, 0.9398746499188371, 0.9267987487771072, 0.9083662495348024, 0.7142857142857141, 0.5018852568617023, 0.16849244223531923, 0.216708650569421, 0.10668868192974135, 0.29453229409064297, 0.026066017187885593, 0.45239096472125984, 0.37220643379052776, 0.9191089977928527, 0.4735593971541673, 0.9369281954807341, 0.02689731756627667, 0.4737672181921908, 0.06798048319432315]"

1352,"Every day I struggle between the contradiction between emotion and rationality. Every day I ask myself whether I am doing the right thing. Are cats and dogs really worthy of people spending a lot of energy to care and love? Are good people really rewarded? Can they really accumulate good deeds? Is it worth it? . Cats and dogs are companion animals. They have intelligence and emotions, and they have become friends of humans over the years. Their existence has brought us a lot of healing and happiness, but at the same time, there are many stray cats and dogs due to |some people abandon them+someone feeds them without sterilizing+disorderly breeding| Stray cats and dogs cannot choose their origin, and it is not their fault that they are homeless. It is not the obligation of any one person or organization to rescue stray animals. Everyone and every unit should sterilize stray cats and dogs in their respective places, feed them at designated locations, and strive to adopt them. Only if everyone in our generation participates in TNR will homelessness be ended in the next generation. Thousands of stray furry children have affected human life and then are dealt with in a simple and crude way. This is not the result that a civilized society should have. Of course, it is impossible for your wishes to be too good. Some students said that we are the minority group and they are the mass group. Although I really don’t want to accept this fact, but... yes. We can&#39;t control what others think, so we must control our emotions and protect ourselves from being consumed as much as possible. Do good people really get rewarded? I really hate the word good person. It&#39;s hard to be a good person, it takes a lot of effort, and you have to be careful with your tail between your legs. People who are indifferent, cold-blooded, and just watching the fun cannot be singled out, and those who abuse cats and dogs will not be punished by law. Will he really accumulate good deeds? have no idea. As long as it&#39;s under your nose, it&#39;s hard to ignore it, just to have a clear conscience.

She yelled and laughed so loudly that people who had experienced Qianfan were as excited as if they were seeing this world for the first time. Even if it’s just a simple ticket bracelet, she would still stare excitedly at how it was put on her hand (the smile here is really cute). Thanks to her sisters and brothers who are traveling with her, they all adhere to the principle of teasing cats and not torturing them. The cat principle, play happily with Duoduo. The third sister played with her on the see-saw, causing her buttocks to jump off her seat. She kicked her legs and struggled at a high place. When she landed, she looked frightened, but she was helpless, and she reluctantly asked someone to pull her before she would leave. Even though she has a bad voice, she still screams at every situation. Even if it is a stone, she still has to shout at it. Finally, she is held in the arms by her sister who is more than ten years younger than her (he looks guilty at the moment after being caught). Cute!) Even the youngest sister is willing to coax her when getting along with her.

1407,"Have you ever had such an experience? Walking alone on the street, I suddenly saw a little stray cat, its eyes full of vigilance and uneasiness, as if there was no corner in this huge world that could provide it with a trace of warmth and safety. So, is there anything we can do for these furry kids? Today, I came to Hangzhou Xianghu Brand Pet Health Research and Development Center with a heart willing to help small animals. This is not only a research and development center, but also a &quot;working paradise&quot; for stray cats full of love and warmth. There is a very special group of kittens here. They once roamed the streets, homeless. But here, not only do they have nothing to worry about, they also have a three-story villa! Brand brand attaches great importance to the actual feeding effect, and all products will undergo strict feeding tests before leaving the factory. They have been cooperating with stray rescue centers before, and recently they built a cat feeding research center, which is a feeding testing center with ceiling-level animal welfare in China. Before the harshest winter arrives, Brand launched an 88-day Warm Winter for Stray Cats at his pet health research and development center! .. It is hoped that with the modest power of the brand, more people will pay attention to those homeless little stray cats. The winter of 2023 is very short, only 88 days, but for many stray cats, this may be their whole life. If stray cats want to survive the winter, there are two very important levels: The first level: fat! Cats need to work hard to find food before the real cold winter arrives, eating themselves fat and storing more fat. Because only in this way can they stay warm in cold weather. Level 2: Hair! With enough fat, after cooling down, the cat can grow thick hair to withstand the coming severe cold. If there is not enough fat storage, then their life is likely to end here. The Brand R&amp;D Center has also set up a &quot;stray cat gas station&quot; so that stray cats around Xianghu Lake no longer live in the open. Friends who are convenient can come here to check in! Just give a high five and donate a pack of cat food to the little strays! You can also receive rescue cat food and give the stray cats around you a full meal! Your little kindness may become a light in their lives✨. Keeping stray cats warm in winter for 88 days! .. An offer that makes Meow’s heart beat.. Be kind to animals.. Refuse to abuse cats and dogs..

1411,"If you can&#39;t sleep, write something. After lunch today, I ordered a cup of Mixue Bingcheng after a long time. When I went back to the dormitory to taste it, I felt it didn&#39;t taste right and was slightly bitter. So I thought about changing it for a drink. Since I was too embarrassed to talk in person and I had already returned to the dormitory, I decided not to go, so I looked for an online method. There was no useful information in identifying the QR code on the cup, so I resigned myself to it, but I was a little unwilling to stop there. At this time, an idea emerged in my mind, a one-stop service platform. In order for students to have a good experience at school, the school has opened a one-stop service platform so that students have something to say and a place to say it. At this time, I was still undecided, so I clicked on it hesitantly and looked through other posts. Everyone has made good use of this platform, praising, suggesting and complaining, and the school official has also responded below each post. After seeing this, I thought it was okay for me to complain. So I clicked on I have something to say and posted a post. Later, I felt it was inappropriate, so I deleted the post and modified it. The complaint was turned into a suggestion. The cafeteria manager called me the first time she saw it and asked me to delete the post and indicate that she was not at the school and would handle the matter as soon as possible after she went to work in the afternoon. I did not expect it to be so efficient. Back at 3pm, I missed the call from the canteen manager while I was at the double election meeting. They communicated in advance that they would contact me after three o&#39;clock, and when I called back, there was no complaint. The general content of the call was that I would find a time to go to Mixue Ice City together and ask the merchant to make a fresh cup and try it to see if it tasted good. From this, we could judge whether this incident was an accident or an ongoing problem with their ingredients. During this rectification, they took me to their back kitchen to see if the ingredients were fresh and hygienic. This is something I didn&#39;t expect. She takes this complaint very seriously and cares about every consumer&#39;s feelings. I can&#39;t help but feel in my heart that she should be the manager. The manager is worthy of being a manager. Actually, I don’t really want to go, I’m shy and sorry. But I couldn&#39;t refuse and had to bite the bullet. Seeing that the three employees were also ready, I seemed to feel a little bit of their nervousness. The whole process went smoothly. In the end, the store manager gave me a cup of milk tea. After returning to the dormitory, I was in a daze for a while, not wanting to do anything. I felt that the energy loss was a bit large, and it took a while to recover. I feel that the canteen manager handled it very well, and the people in Mixue Bingcheng are also very sincere. They always think about this matter unconsciously. Maybe it is because they can&#39;t sleep because they are thinking about this matter. I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m making a fuss out of a molehill. I could have asked them to make a cup again but I chose to complain on the platform. I&#39;m wondering if my complaint is a bit excessive. I&#39;m wondering if the employees who wanted to make that cup of Mixue Ice City will be dissatisfied because of this. My wages were deducted, and I wonder if they will become more strict because of this. I think I consumed it and there is indeed no problem in complaining because of their mistake. But everyone doesn’t want to go to work, so it doesn’t matter if I make a mistake once or muddle along. Can I guarantee 100% energy when I go to work in the future? The employee looked like he had just started working. Could it have some impact on his heart? He even thought about him smoking and cursed in his mind, saying, &quot;Why don&#39;t I complain?&quot; He was deducted from his salary and had to memorize the ingredient list even more. . As I write this, I suddenly feel that I am sick. I am thinking about a series of things that may not happen at all. Why am I so embarrassed? Why am I complaining? He just didn&#39;t do a good job. I have the right to complain. What am I doing here thinking about it? Is this against PUA? I really don&#39;t understand. I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know if I regret it. It seems like I regret it. I don’t know. It&#39;s indeed a bit too much. I obviously asked them to memorize the ingredient list, but I sympathized with them and couldn&#39;t understand myself. I probably won’t go to Mixue Ice City and the shops there for a while. Maybe it won&#39;t be possible until they forget my appearance. It’s better not to go this semester.

The authoritative media “Huashang Daily” published “Xi’an 80-year-old The old lady spent 9,960 yuan to buy 64 pieces of donkey-hide gelatin after listening to a health lecture. &quot;Bai Shoukang&quot; was ordered to close down due to the incident.

A boss from Shandong gave a lecture on donkey hide gelatin. A reporter from the Huashang Daily reported the incident to the Huancheng West Road Food and Drug Administration. In early February this year, 80-year-old Ms. Liang was walking near Hanguangmen in Xi&#39;an City when a young man handed her a flyer and left her contact information. A few days later, a woman contacted her to attend a health lecture, saying it was good for her health. Later, Ms. Liang went to attend a lecture on the 6th floor of Dongguang Building near Huancheng West Road in Xi&#39;an. There were forty or fifty elderly people sitting in the lecture hall, listening to a boss who claimed to be from Shandong to talk about donkey-hide gelatin. For dozens of minutes, I kept talking about how good donkey-hide gelatin is. Ms. Liang was still hesitant to buy it at first. The staff gave her corn flour and other things, so she decided to buy two pieces of donkey-hide gelatin blocks. “It was embarrassing to just accept other people’s stuff. A box of 4 cost 4,980 yuan, so they let me take it.” For two copies, I was charged 9,960 yuan.&quot; The reporter found that the same type of Beijing Tongrentang donkey-hide gelatin block sold online for 358 yuan for 250 grams, a price difference of nearly 3.5 times.

A staff member from the Food and Drug Administration surnamed Gao said that after a preliminary investigation, neither relevant leaflets nor the items such as donkey-hide gelatin and camel milk mentioned by the elderly were found. Although the qualifications are legal, the donkey-hide gelatin sold cannot provide purchase receipts and manufacturer qualifications, and does not disclose prices, which affects the on-site investigation. &quot;According to the provisions of the Food Safety Law, we ordered the store to close and required the legal representative to submit relevant information. Submit it to the Food and Drug Administration. Further investigation will follow.&quot; A staff member surnamed Gao said that the blood test issue mentioned by Ms. Liang may be suspected of &quot;illegal medical practice&quot; and needs to be handled by the Lianhu District Health Bureau. (Chinese Business News) After the blogger reprinted the report, many bloggers contacted me recently and asked to delete the post. Some bloggers failed to delete the post and directly sent private messages saying that the article was untrue, so they simply reported the post, which was eventually deleted. First of all, the blogger is reprinting an authoritative investigation article from Huashang Newspaper. So, what exactly is he trying to hide with this move! The blogger once again issued a solemn reminder to everyone to prevent the elderly at home from being deceived. Nine out of ten people who attend lectures claiming to be health care products are scammers.

On November 1, 2022, the Beizhangzhuang Town Government made false claims to the Hebei Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau for the 14th time in a row, requesting a thorough investigation!

Request a thorough investigation of the fraud of Handan Iron and Steel Group and the protective umbrella behind Handan Iron and Steel Group, and reissue or compensate for statutory treatment in accordance with the law! During the 2022 all-employee nucleic acid test period, Handan Iron and Steel sent many people in multiple batches to break into private homes day and night, and forced their way into hospital checkpoints to hinder epidemic prevention and control. They called the police 8 times and still refused to evacuate with arrogance. We were threatened and pressured by many departments, and the Internet exposed Posts were frantically deleted, traffic was restricted, and accounts were blocked, and the mobile phone containing the evidence was forcibly taken away and the evidence was destroyed! On June 23, 2022, Zhang Xianzheng, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Handan Iron and Steel Group, came home and admitted that the chain of evidence was falsified, but refused to compensate or provide any legal treatment. On June 24, he received a threatening call from Handan Iron and Steel Group claiming that he was &quot;not afraid of anything&quot;! Since the complaint, the complaint has been in &quot;Hebei Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau - Hebei Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission - Hebei Iron and Steel Group - Handan Iron and Steel Group &quot;were idle or false. They kept complaining about Handan Iron and Steel Group&#39;s fraud, but they always made Handan Iron and Steel Group both the defendant and the referee, and repeatedly induced people to sign. Then they made up the story but refused to produce any legal evidence. Handan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. had opened up relationships at all levels in Hebei Province and had been conducting false transactions without our knowledge; on April 22, 2022, the leaders of Handan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. imposed organizational sanctions and waited until the children went to school and returned home. The workplace exerted pressure and threats, requesting a thorough investigation! My father, Zhang Huisen, is a disabled veteran. He worked at Handan Iron and Steel Equipment Manufacturing and Installation Co., Ltd. from 1991 to the end of 2012. He was awarded advanced status and suffered a work-related injury (hospitalized in Handan Iron and Steel Hospital). He was dismissed by Handan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. at the age of 60, but Handang Iron and Steel Group never gave him any compensation. I paid any social security and forged a labor dispatch agreement. There was no agreement content, no signature or fingerprint, and no photocopying or taking photos. I was only told that I signed a contract with a labor dispatch company in May 2011. I asked to see the &quot;fake agreement&quot; many times. &quot; text was rejected; (Handan Congtai Ark Human Resources Co., Ltd. and Handan Hongwei Loading and Unloading Service Co., Ltd., which Handan Iron and Steel falsely responded to after the report, were respectively established on May 21, 2007 on the official websites of Tianyancha and Qichacha. and January 4, 2007, and both have been cancelled.

It used to be an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China salary card. After activation, it was not used and was changed to a China Bank card. After that, all payments were made in cash. I reported to my father Zhang Huimin, the secretary of his section and the job introducer, sought confirmation that his father was not involved in labor dispatch, and that his salary had always been paid by Handan Iron and Steel!

1540,"I spent a day visiting the auto show last Saturday. When I came to the auto show, my boss told me to go home early to take care of the baby. So, during the auto show, I walked around in a hurry and lacked quality. At around 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, I first went to the square outside the exhibition venue to watch the emotional car show. It was crowded and lively. Teacher Yan and Yuan, who didn&#39;t see everyone&#39;s cars, probably came at the wrong time, which was a bit regretful. I bought a ticket to enter the auto show and spent 70 yuan. I was worried that the ticket was fake. There were many people scalping tickets outside the venue. They were giving away tickets. If you sell them, you will make money. Entering the auto show, with the mentality that new energy vehicles are already domestically produced, I just glanced at the booths of traditional car companies and didn&#39;t even bother to take a look. Obviously, the current popularity of gas-powered cars is not as high as that of electric cars. Domestic electric cars are much more refined and intelligent than gas-powered cars, at least in terms of appearance. They feel that they are not products of the same era. After seeing the actual scene of the ideal MEGA, The appearance is not that surprising, it is novel and strange. The front of the car is a bit like a mouse, silly, and the side looks more majestic, after all, the length of 5.3 meters is there. The Xpeng X9 was actually surrounded and no one was allowed to see it. I wanted to sit on it, but I was a little disappointed. There are also many car brands whose names I can’t remember, such as Moody and Xiangtianwang. I have no interest in them and haven’t looked at them.

I would like to clarify it directly here. 1. Female film director Zhang Xuyu @zhangxuyu and producer Fan Zhijie @affantino privately chatted about the privacy of women’s lives, as shown in Figure 2. Does the content of their chat count as oral sex? Does it count as sexual harassment? Seeing Zhang Xuyu’s complaint about this in Figure 1, these two high-quality men must have felt that their behavior was very normal and did not offend women at all. What I can&#39;t understand is where the malicious screenshot comes from? Where is the malice? If the two men have no doubt that their past remarks have harmed women&#39;s privacy and disrespected women, and have refused to apologize so far, why are they so reluctant to expose the chat content in Figure 2 that even offending her privacy can be considered an infringement? Complain about deletion of posts due to privacy reasons? 2. The female film &quot;Fishbone&quot; co-produced by Zhang Xuyu and Fan Zhijie was filmed in violation of tax laws.

How did I get into the seventh grade of Dezheng Middle School when I failed all the exams before entering school and scored more than ten points on one subject? So far, outside students from Dezheng Middle School are still entering the school one after another, but each student needs a school selection fee of several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Principal Li ignores the regulations of the Education Bureau and enrolls students in violation of regulations. As a school The principal does not pay attention to education, but recruits a large number of outside students to make a lot of money after taking office. I wonder if Principal Li’s background is strong or if the Education Bureau is lame?

During this period, it is hoped that the relevant departments will strictly investigate illegal enrollment practices. It is also hoped that Comrade Li Yong, the principal of Dezheng Middle School, will recruit students from primary school to junior high school in 2023. The work should be made public to ensure educational fairness and equal rights in Wei County, so that educational fairness can be implemented in place, instead of letting Principal Li of Dezheng Middle School frantically delete posts.

I had quite a few bosses, and I also placed orders and played with them. This is a huge amount (much higher than my live broadcast gift commission). You may say that this is of my own free will, so I would like to ask, did I force her to buy the gift? Wasn’t it also voluntary? So, I don’t know the whole picture, so don’t make random comments about making money. I have always asked my fans to use less or not to use it at all. I have a salary and a receipt, so I don’t need a few gifts. 3. We have quarreled quite a few times in the past few months (I won’t tell you why, it’s all my fault), but this time she asked me to take down the fan group I just posted to that fan group without a brand, Otherwise, she will quit the management. This time I broke up and blacklisted her because I really couldn&#39;t bear it anymore. It was also irrational, but it doesn&#39;t matter. Looking forward now, I will learn a lesson. I also wish her well in the future. 4. This is also my last post in Gua Bar. I will not reply any more. If you still want to scold me, please continue. I will delete the post in January next year. I have also switched to gaming. Goodbye No. 5 and Goodbye Gua Ge.

1603,"Zhanshuang Pamish &quot;About a Zhanshuanger creator who was slightly shocked by the library block&quot; reminds everyone to be careful when posting in the library block. There are too many users who don&#39;t understand the etiquette of second creation, and I am also the first The first time I saw a character making a black face and cursing the character to death. The reason was that the poster posted a picture related to Vanessa in the Library District. This picture was also posted on lof (see p1 for details), which resulted in the following comments (p2, 3). This includes promoting the character, using the insulting word &quot;it&quot;, and implicitly implying that people who like the character are all the same. Insulting the poster who is ■■, discriminating against you as a new player (feeling a little newbie shock), and impassionedly accusing the original artist of not marking the author is a double standard behavior. There are also some insulting remarks that have not been intercepted and will not be displayed. Maybe the poster was biased in calling the other party&#39;s behavior a photo theft. Although the other party objectively caused the photo theft, subjectively he believed it was ordinary sharing. Then according to the other party&#39;s words, it is a normal sharing. The poster cut out the following rules to prove that the other party&#39;s behavior is illegal, and sincerely hopes that the commander can obtain authorization within the limited period or delete the post (p4). Then came the best part. The commander backhandedly deleted the comments he had made that scolded me, and said that he was not scolding the poster, but was just expressing his opinion (p5). Due to the proficiency of the other party, I have reason to suspect that this is not the first time that these things have happened. I hope that all secondary creators can take this as a warning. If you encounter such a person, you can just organize it directly. Reasoning will not work.

Principal Li ignores the regulations of the Education Bureau and enrolls students in violation of regulations. As a school The principal does not pay attention to education, but recruits a large number of outside students to make a lot of money after taking office. I wonder if Principal Li’s background is strong or if the Education Bureau is lame?

During this period, it is hoped that the relevant departments will strictly investigate illegal enrollment practices. It is also hoped that Comrade Li Yong, the principal of Dezheng Middle School, will recruit students from primary school to junior high school in 2023.

How did I get into the seventh grade of Dezheng Middle School when I failed all the exams before entering school and scored more than ten points on one subject? So far, outside students from Dezheng Middle School are still entering the school one after another, but each student needs a school selection fee of several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Principal Li ignores the regulations of the Education Bureau and enrolls students in violation of regulations. As a school The principal does not pay attention to education, but recruits a large number of outside students to make a lot of money after taking office. I wonder if Principal Li’s background is strong or if the Education Bureau is lame? The Ninth Inspection Team of the Provincial Party Committee has launched an inspection of Wei County from October 16 to December 15, 2023. During this period, it is hoped that the relevant departments will strictly investigate illegal enrollment practices. It is also hoped that Comrade Li Yong, the principal of Dezheng Middle School, will recruit students from primary school to junior high school in 2023. The work should be made public to ensure educational fairness and equal rights in Wei County, so that educational fairness can be implemented in place, instead of letting Principal Li of Dezheng Middle School frantically delete posts.

1671,"My &quot;bet&quot; was right! 59 asked a semi-retired old man to perform an &quot;anchoring ligament lift&quot; on me, and the effect was really amazing! I had long been worried about having a facelift, but I also waited and watched for a long time, because I found that each doctor&#39;s speech seemed to make sense, but what they said was different. The more I listened, the more confused I became, so I had to I read a lot of post-surgery feedback and saw that some sisters said on the Internet that they were disfigured, but their posts were deleted the next day. Some people also said that they were disfigured but they couldn&#39;t do anything and they were blamed. I think A little scary. I chose the director, a semi-retired person, to do the surgery out of trust. After all, he has been in the industry for 34 years, has performed more than 10,000 facelift surgeries with zero negative reviews, and has the title of chief physician of the Ministry of Health. This half reassured me. In addition, his shortcomings are quite safe. After entering the traffic era for several years, he still has high arrogance and looks down on traffic Internet celebrities. As a result, his reputation is lower now. He does not look like an Internet celebrity doctor with long hands. I think Relatively more reliable and safer. I have to say that the old doctor was stubborn and insisted that I be hospitalized for 5 days, but he gave me an irresistible reason: &quot;In the first 5 days, either nothing happens, or hematoma disfigures me. If you step back ten thousand steps, you will still be there even if something happens.&quot; Under my nose, if something happens, I don&#39;t even have room to shirk. I&#39;m not afraid of trouble. What are you afraid of?&quot; I felt that this stubborn old man was very responsible, so I agreed to stay for 5 days.

1805,"The most uncomfortable thing about Episode 10 is the true reaction. No matter how men fight among themselves in the workplace, when facing women, they can use their male superiority and gender-specific hobbies to exclude women. Originally, they deliberately arranged the business meeting at the golf course without informing Wen Huixin. This is a very obvious gender-based exclusion and isolation in the workplace. In addition to the large number of people and the gathering of male hobbies and desires, another method used is sexual harassment in the workplace, including but not limited to the pun-intended &quot;third hole&quot; mentioned in this episode. In this episode, men in the workplace use their gender to exclude women. I have basically experienced similar things. For example, they smoked heavily in front of me during meetings, they went to the corridor to smoke together when they needed to have private conversations, and after a business dinner, we walked together to a place where sex and violence were done. , give me a subtle and obvious gender exclusion of &quot;you are different from us&quot;, &quot;you can&#39;t share dirty secrets like brothers&quot;, &quot;how can you and us be honest with each other like brothers&quot; . My boss once told his secretary that I should have been promoted long ago, but unfortunately I was not at the headquarters. What was even more unfortunate was that I was a woman and could only get second-tier opportunities. So after watching this episode, those memories of dying while working started to attack me again. But fortunately, I am now a lawyer. Although I still bear the issue of gender disadvantage, I can make my own decisions in most situations. Why are men naturally united in the workplace and actively and tacitly exploit women? It is not the work itself that creates oppression, but the social relations that sustain this system of exploitation. I think the core is that patriarchy is at the core of capitalism. So the problem is superficially a problem of social role stereotypes and their socialization, but the root cause is patriarchy. These institutions and facilities define women as part of nature and must be controlled and dominated by men. As Beauvoir said, &quot;In ancient times, an absolute vertical line was used as a reference to illustrate other oblique lines, but now the male is established as an absolute human standard. Being a man is always right, because he Being a man; being a woman is always wrong.” Under the patriarchal system based on men, women have never formed an independent closed society. They are combined with the male dominant group and occupy a subordinate position in the group. status; they are merely of the same kind, bound together by a mechanical agreement: there is no organic agreement between them on which a unified community is built...&quot; Therefore, they hold a common belief that the patriarchal social order is the The only feasible basis is that the male-dominated political system around the world has become their common serious political commitment. Therefore, based on the common belief of patriarchy, men are particularly united based on gender discrimination. Among them, gender segregation and exclusion of women are male employees. A way to gain internal unity. So why are women so easily divided? Because the patriarchal system unites men with each other, but separates women from each other. Women are either their mother&#39;s daughters or mothers of daughters, and they do not have an identity of their own. Or, because they do not have the resources, they have to compete with each other for men to gain the power behind them. Therefore, the improvement of &quot;News Queen&quot; and &quot;The Evil of the Golden Branch&quot; is that they both choose powerful men. Some old, smooth and unattractive images, thus portraying the weakness and emptiness of power itself. What women compete for is never men, but power itself, which has nothing to do with sex.

1807,"I spent one day over the weekend and watched the 15 episodes of &quot;The Beginning&quot;. I feel that an episode of about 45 minutes (second from left, third from right) including the opening and ending songs is the best arrangement for the length of a single episode of the series. Everything is in the right rhythm, very Comfortable. I wonder if there is any scientific reason for this, just like a school class is also 45 minutes long (if I remember correctly). Some dramas are good to watch, but if they are 50+ or even one hour or 79 minutes per episode, even if the number of episodes is less than 15, it feels like it will take at least two days to watch, and it cannot be watched in one day. Compared with the continuous loop of reasoning and thrilling tense scenes, what goes deeper into my heart is the family story behind the people on the bus. They are not refined, noble or elegant, they are plain and simple but have the purest passion. The unemployed migrant worker who lives in a garage, sanitary napkins are a luxury item to his daughter, but he is willing to give one to the heroine who &quot;urgently needs it&quot;. And it was so difficult for him that when he was hesitant to help capture the murderer, he decided to help when he confirmed that he might be able to do something for the reward. His story will remain etched in my heart for a long time. I always feel that they are me, and I am them, with no fixed place to live, no one to rely on, working the lowest level of hard work, earning a meager salary and fearing that my job may not be available tomorrow, and having to spend a lot of time looking for one. No matter how hard you work to earn a living, you don’t dare to take a break even if you work hard and work hard. I remember when I was a child and a few months ago I saw motorcycle passengers squatting on the roadside squatting to eat and make a living by carrying passengers. When I saw them, I felt that my body would be overwhelmed by the endless sorrow and the heaviness of powerlessness. Perhaps it is also because of my concern for these relevant social issues that I feel very uncomfortable with the ending, which seems to avoid the important points and rush to the happy reunion. I feel that the whole drama is just picking up the drama and putting it down gently. . It is difficult for people at the bottom to make a living, and they are willing to risk their lives for bonuses. They live in a dignified environment and cannot afford sanitary napkins. They are molested on public transportation and have no way to complain. They dare not speak out for fear of retaliation. Sexual harassment offenders receive light sentences. The victim is guilty (for wearing a short skirt). is a sin), the voice of justice for online violence. All justice can only attract attention through the &quot;injustice&quot; of the victim to retaliate, and can be realized in the time reversal that is impossible to happen in reality. Each one is a very heavy and profound social issue, but in the end it ends lightly, as if it was just blown by the wind. Maybe there are reasons for the script creator’s skill, reasons for censorship, or reasons that cannot be explained. I wish there were more and more in-depth works exploring these issues, but the fact that they are mentioned is a grudging consolation. But I remembered another sentence, late justice is not justice (it is just comfort). Just sigh.

1809,"Wang Sleeping, the Love of the Superior When this season of &quot;Goodbye My Lover&quot; was first aired, everyone had very good comments about Wang Sleeping: sober, rational, sharp, and with three correct views. At the wedding, her bridesmaid was sexually harassed by Zhang Shuo&#39;s friend. Zhang Shuo apologized to her friend, but did not let the person who committed the sexual harassment apologize. For this reason, Wang Sleeping has never been able to get over this hurdle, because she feels that if a person does not even have a basic sense of justice and morality, then she should consider marrying this person. So it&#39;s been three years since the wedding took place, but she hasn&#39;t received the certificate yet. At that time, everyone thought that it was because of this incident that Sleepy was having a hard time with it, which affected her relationship with Zhang Shuo. After looking at it, I found that it was not entirely like this. Today I saw Question 36. It has been 18 days. Wang Sleepy and Zhang Shuo acted as if nothing had happened. The way and content of their quarrel was just like the first day of recording the show. The two of them seemed to be going around in circles, with nothing changing. Sleepy and Zhang Shuo are obviously not on the same level of intelligence. Regardless of IQ, EQ or adaptability, Zhang Shuo is worse than sleepy. Talking to Zhang Shuo, Sleepy felt like an examiner was testing a student. Every word he said was trying to catch his loopholes. However, Zhang Shuo accurately stepped on Wang Sleepy&#39;s minefield every time, making Wang Sleepy furious. Furious. When I was watching it, I was thinking: Zhang Shuo needs a speaking coach to guide him when he talks to Wang Sleepy. How do you answer the question she asked to avoid lightning. Otherwise, with your IQ, you won’t be able to handle it. Everyone doesn&#39;t understand what Wang Sleepy likes about Zhang Shuo? He is not good-looking, has poor earning power, and often loses money. He is always ambitious and wants to make a lot of money. His ability to recognize people is not good either, and those who defraud him of money are all people he considers to be his friends. If he is just not handsome and has poor earning power, he can be talented, but Zhang Shuo obviously has no talent. If you don&#39;t have talent, you can be smart enough, but Zhang Shuo is obviously not smart. If he were smart enough, he wouldn&#39;t enter Sleepy&#39;s minefield one after another to make Sleepy angry. Finally, if there is nothing wrong with this man, if he is willing to give you his money, it means that he also loves you. However, Zhang Shuo&#39;s house did not have Wang Sleeping&#39;s name written on it, but Wang Sleeping was required to repay the loan together (the two did not obtain the certificate). Zhang Shuo is not handsome, motivated, smart, and has no money. What does Wang Sleepy like about him? Just like Fu Seoul said: As long as you guys are arguing like this, I don’t think you need to go on the show to separate, we can just separate offline. But there is no point in sleeping. Not only was there no score, she was still wavering in the last two days as to whether or not to get off the train. The first ten days were divorce by choice. On the last day, just because Zhang Shuo accompanied her down the mountain to use the toilet, she chose &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; on the answer sheet. She was shaken. Wang sleeps so well. She doesn&#39;t want much, she just needs Zhang Shuo to be nice to her. This kind of kindness is actually very cheap, such as cleaning her shoes, picking up food for her when eating, putting sunscreen on her when going out, bringing sunscreen spray, and accompanying her to the toilet when she wants to go down the mountain in the middle of the night. It&#39;s enough to care about her in every detail in life, give her a sense of ritual during festivals, and send her flowers. It feels like what she needs is a life assistant, not a lover. Her requirements for her significant other are somewhat similar to our requirements for a nanny. Someone who is evenly matched with her is unlikely to be willing to be her life assistant all the time, and is unlikely to serve her front and back. Zhang Shuo, whose IQ, EQ, appearance and work ability are far inferior to hers, can serve him in every detail. He once relied on this kind of front-and-back service (what Wang Sleepy thought was &quot;good&quot;) to catch up with Wang Sleeping, but now he has taken back part of this &quot;goodness&quot;, so this is the source of their conflict. As long as Zhang Shuo returns to the way he was pursuing sleep before getting married, returns to that state, returns to the state where she is his world, they can continue to live happily. The harassment at the wedding was one factor that affected their relationship, but it was certainly not the entire factor. I thought about it, if it was my own wedding and my friend was harassed by the groom’s friend, I would definitely flip the table and ask him to make that person apologize immediately. If he didn’t dare, I would take his phone and call him directly. The instigator sent a message and called, demanding an apology. I will not let this matter wait for three years, and I will not let my friends become strangers to me because of this matter. The fact that Sleepy can endure it for three years shows that this matter is not unbearable enough for her to leave immediately. If Zhang Shuo doesn&#39;t solve this matter, she can always stand on the moral high ground to accuse him, and then use him to achieve a certain balance. I would venture to guess that sleeping in a family of origin means a little lack of love. Only girls who don&#39;t get love in their original family, or don&#39;t get enough love, will be attracted by the &quot;goodness&quot; from the opposite sex. Sleepy also said that the reason she married Zhang Shuo was because she thought Zhang Shuo&#39;s parents were very good. She felt that his parents were such good people, so their son should be good too. Speaking of this, I think of a friend of mine who was chased by his wife. He said that his wife was a classmate of his younger sister. She grew up in a family that valued boys over girls and did not receive much care. Once, my wife went to his house to play and saw the way their family members got along with each other. It was something she had never seen in her family of origin. She wanted to join such a family, so she chased my friend and got married to him. Got married. Marriage is a rebirth for a woman. Her love is not satisfied in her family of origin and she hopes to be satisfied in her family. Many people are like this, and I used to be like this too. I guess Wang Sleepy is like this, but of course it&#39;s just a guess. If this guess is true, it is not difficult to understand why Wang Sleepy is so hard-spoken and soft-hearted, and cannot do without Zhang Shuo. Just like in today&#39;s 36 questions, although she was heartbroken, what she said while crying in the car was: I thought I could reunite with him today, why did I mess everything up again? In her heart she didn&#39;t want to separate. So another question: Does Zhang Shuo love Wang Shuisue? In the show, Papi Jiang said that it felt like Zhang Shuo didn&#39;t love Wang Sleepy. I think Zhang Shuo doesn&#39;t understand love at all. He is 30 years old and thinks of himself as a boy all day long. We have all gone through the stage of youth and ignorance, and children&#39;s love is like playing house. Therefore, Zhang Shuo&#39;s understanding of love is still at the stage of a high school student: treat her well, listen to her orders, listen to her words, and give her some food, that is loving her. He chased her until she fell asleep, just like a child who saved up enough pocket money to buy an expensive piece of art. One day he found that he had accidentally broken the artwork. He panicked because he might never buy the same piece of art again, so he wanted to glue the piece of art back together. But the process of gluing the artwork was very trivial. He was a little impatient but had to do it. Maybe he won&#39;t understand until the artwork is completely damaged by him during the gluing process. Some things can&#39;t be repaired if they&#39;re broken, and some people don&#39;t have them anymore once they&#39;re lost. Zhang Shuo&#39;s growth may come after losing Wang Sleepy. Will Wang Sleeping leave Zhang Shuo? I&#39;m not sure. Just like her relationship with Zhang Shuo, she actually had big problems herself, asking questions aggressively. Zhang Shuo looked like a primary school student who couldn&#39;t answer questions in front of her. The more he was afraid of making mistakes, the more mistakes he would make. Is it a big deal to ask before giving a gift? To us adults, this is nothing. Because he was worried that if he sent it to the wrong person and you said he had bad taste, he wanted to ask. But from Wang Sleeping&#39;s point of view, she felt humiliated by having to ask her before giving gifts. Sleep also needs to grow up. When one day, she no longer appears as a superior in relationships, and her standard for measuring relationships is no longer based on whether the other person is good enough for her, she may have matured. . But growth comes at a cost. Giving up the relationships of the past ten years and the sunk costs of the past ten years require the courage to cut through the mess quickly. I wish Sleepy had such courage.

1823,"If you send a private message to your husband and your husband can’t receive it, help me forward it to your husband. You should be very confident in your husband’s mind. Thank you, and don’t think I’m being extreme. Don’t be a masculine hater. I found that you are very sexist and have a vicious male-hating mentality. I don’t know why you are so male-hating. I’ve made several quotes out of context. Sexist stereotypes about male and female differences. Men now reject stereotypes and do not say sexist things about women such as men having higher IQs than women. Women also reject stereotypes with double standards. For example, they will definitely recognize this if it is beneficial to them. But they also like stereotypes and sexism, saying that men’s empathy is not as strong as women’s. And you always use sexist stereotypes, and women are better than men. After a while, men are worse than women. Are you not a male? I don’t see many people who have a vicious and male-hating mentality and hate their own gender. It is said that women should embarrass women, but since I saw your husband’s vicious and male-hating comments, I feel that men like your husband hate their own gender to the extreme, but they are also very narcissistic and hate all men except themselves. Label them with vicious labels, vicious stereotypes. What kind of men are required by society not to observe other people&#39;s needs? Only women care about other people&#39;s needs. As a man, I have never had such an experience. I have been comparing myself to others since I was a child, and I often think from other people&#39;s perspective. On the contrary, today&#39;s society has poisonous chicken soup female boxing ideas, princess The disease is far greater than the prince&#39;s disease! What else are you saying about complaining about your wife and your husband? May I ask why your husband doesn’t say that he is a gentleman? Men should let women go. It is natural for men to support their families. These words and phrases label and morally kidnap men and criticize them? Your husband is a deformed, vicious and male-hating man who can’t even empathize with his own gender. To put it bluntly, how can we expect you to be a kind person just by looking at your face and talking about him? Or is it just for traffic and to harvest female leeks? Is it the ultimate vicious misogyny, or are you just trying to prove your superiority over other men? Who is the best at learning masculinity? Are you the only one in your world who is an outstanding man with good morals? I have discovered that many vicious men who hate men and women have fallen out of favor in recent years, such as Zhou Xuanyi and Shi Hang who were exposed for sexual harassment. And recently, Li SY, your husband’s guest group colleague, was also accused of sexual crimes by a female netizen. Is it because the female boxer’s vicious male rivalry and male dislike mentality means that he feels that he is superior to other men? Who is the best at learning masculinity? Or is he just a bad guy, so he thinks all men are the same as him? Vicious male competition and male-haters are ten times more intense and vicious than female competition! On the contrary, I think people who can empathize with their own gender are generally really excellent in all aspects, such as Andy Lau, who has also sung, &quot;It&#39;s not a sin for a man to cry. @ Yang Geli @黄志中, since your husband can be vicious and aggressive Men can&#39;t even empathize with their own gender, and they still label men with sexist labels that they don&#39;t have, and use stereotypes to randomly define the differences between men and women. How vicious the psychology is! To flaunt one&#39;s superiority over other men! I am the best virtuoso in the world. Be your best. Don’t you feel horrible about such vicious and selfish people? Jay Chou, Andy Lau, Luo Yunxi, the outstanding men I like, they all empathize with their own gender, these are the outstanding men, both men and women like them, they are real and not hypocritical. Luo Yunxi was interviewed by a female reporter about the topic of straight men. He said that boys nowadays are all coaxers. When a female reporter told H Xiaoming how to preserve food without getting greasy, she mocked H Xiaoming. He said just be yourself!

1844,"What exactly is sexual harassment? My colleagues have asked me this question, fans have asked me, and male classmates who want to keep themselves clean have also asked me. In my opinion, the answer is actually very simple. If the other person&#39;s actions, words, or even the look in his eyes make you feel sexual discomfort, it is sexual harassment. The judgment of sexual harassment is based only on the subjective feelings of the victim, not the subjective wishes of the offender. So if we feel harassed in our daily life, we don’t need to think about whether the perpetrator has no malicious intent or whether he was careless. Instead, we should respect our own feelings and point out the inappropriateness of these behaviors. We want to use this video to further clarify what sexual harassment is, and what victims, bystanders, and perpetrators can do when facing sexual harassment. We hope that one day, these contents can become common knowledge that no longer needs to be popularized. I also highly recommend everyone to watch the short film &quot;By Your Side&quot; shot by L&#39;Oréal Paris x Shanyi, co-directed by Han Xia and actor Xin Zhilei. The short film once again answers the questions of what sexual harassment is and what we should do about it. &quot;Beside You&quot; depicts two scenes of sexual harassment in the workplace and sexual harassment from strangers. As a colleague and friend of the victim, Xin Zhilei was by her side, believed in her, and gave her the strength to speak out and resist. L&#39;Oréal Paris has also released &quot;She Guards 36 Strategies&quot;, which can help us identify invisible harassment behaviors in life, and also give us how to deal with some specific situations as bystanders. We will post the link in the comment area. We hope that You can learn about it, but you will never use it. LAlex is definitely a girl’s Weibo video.

1845,"Too bloody! In Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province, a couple was toasting to the guests at a wedding. Suddenly, the father-in-law, who had drunk too much, picked up the daughter-in-law next to him. After putting her daughter-in-law down, she still hugged her waist. The mother-in-law next to her suddenly turned green. Got it! Netizen: Never let father-in-law and daughter-in-law be alone! Guo Xiaosong&#39;s hometown is a quiet and ancient town, surrounded by green mountains and gurgling rivers. The people here are old-fashioned and traditional, and marriage is still an extremely important matter for many families. Guo Xiaosong, an ordinary and slightly dull young man, at the age of 28, under the supervision of his family, began a blind date journey for a long-awaited lifelong event. Xiaosong&#39;s mother ran around for his marriage, looking for a suitable girl for him again and again. However, Xiaosong&#39;s dullness and poor words prevented him from impressing several girls after meeting them. Until one day, he met Zhang Yuting. Yuting&#39;s beautiful appearance and slender figure made Xiaosong excited. When they met for the first time, Yuting&#39;s generosity and initiative made him feel an unprecedented sense of comfort. The two had a pleasant exchange and left each other&#39;s contact information. Not long after, Yuting came to Xiaosong&#39;s house as a guest and explored Xiaosong&#39;s life and family. Although Xiaosong&#39;s family background is solid, his introversion and ordinary appearance make Yuting more interested in him. The luxurious decoration of Xiaomatsu&#39;s home also makes her look forward to the future. As a result, the relationship between the two quickly heated up and they reached the point of discussing marriage. The day of the engagement party finally arrived. On this day, the home was decorated with joy and lanterns were hung high. Xiaosong&#39;s father, Lao Guo, is a middle-aged man who looks ordinary but has a delicate mind. He is particularly concerned about his son&#39;s marriage. At the banquet, Lao Guo&#39;s concern for his daughter-in-law was beyond ordinary. A pair of eyes stared directly at the daughter-in-law, seeming to have an unspeakable meaning. As the banquet progressed, Lao Guo gradually became a little tipsy. He stood in front of every table, his tipsy smile revealing happiness and satisfaction. Friends congratulated him on getting a virtuous and beautiful daughter-in-law. When Lao Guo heard the compliment, he was immediately elated. However, what happened next made the entire banquet instantly quiet. After congratulating her, an old friend suddenly said to Lao Guo: &quot;Congratulations, Lao Guo, you have a virtuous and beautiful daughter-in-law!&quot; Lao Guo couldn&#39;t help but smile triumphantly when he heard his friend&#39;s compliment. Then, he walked to his daughter-in-law Yuting without hesitation. Yu Ting stood aside, wearing a gorgeous cheongsam showing her graceful figure. Lao Guo&#39;s smile became even brighter, and he suddenly hugged Yu Ting. Yu Ting did not signal resistance, but swayed her cheongsam sensibly. This sudden scene stunned everyone present. Lao Guo hugged his daughter-in-law and said to everyone with a smile: &quot;We... have a custom... that is, the father-in-law wants to carry his daughter-in-law into the house... I will give it a try today...&quot; For a moment, everyone was surprised and embarrassed. , the scene was silent. The sudden action shocked everyone, and the scene was extremely embarrassing. A blush appeared on Yuting&#39;s face, but out of respect for her elders, she did not show displeasure and just lowered her head shyly. The mother-in-law next to her was even more flushed, with dissatisfaction and embarrassment flashing in her eyes. But it was difficult for her to have an attack in front of so many guests. Lao Guo seemed to be completely unaware, his smile was still bright, and he never put down the wine glass in his hand. He held Yu Ting high and maintained an intimate posture. Everyone&#39;s eyes turned to the bride and groom, and the atmosphere of the wedding was instantly broken by this unexpected scene. However, Lao Guo did not stop because of this, and still held his daughter-in-law&#39;s waist. It was not until others reminded him that Lao Guo put down his hand, but looked at Yu Ting with happiness on his face. The whole scene fell into an eerie silence, followed by applause. People applauded, perhaps surprised by this sudden move, or cheering for the happiness of the newlyweds. The wedding continued, but Lao Guo&#39;s performance became the focus of the day and was talked about by people. A guest at the scene recorded a video of this scene and posted it online, which immediately aroused heated discussion. Some netizens said, It doesn’t matter if there is no such father-in-law. Is this making other people laugh? Where is my son? Where is your mother-in-law? No matter what the reason is, I will never agree to hug you! Some netizens said that the father-in-law was trying to be a gangster by drinking, so why didn&#39;t so many women hug him and try to get one step ahead of him? Some netizens expressed their understanding and thought that this was no problem. It was a happy wedding and just a joke, and my father-in-law would not be like this normally. First of all, from an emotional and moral perspective, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior was obviously inappropriate. Although in Chinese culture, there are no strict boundaries between father-in-law and daughter-in-law. But on this occasion, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior obviously violated the generally accepted moral norms of society, that is, appropriate distance and respect should be maintained between father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Secondly, from a legal perspective, although Lao Guo&#39;s behavior may not constitute a crime. However, his behavior may be considered obscene or sexual harassment. In addition, from a legal perspective, Lao Guo&#39;s behavior while drunk may involve issues of legal liability. If Lao Guo loses his normal ability to judge and control due to drunkenness, his legal liability may be reduced. However, this needs to be based on specific legal provisions and court judgment. Specifically, the &quot;Women&#39;s Rights and Interests Protection Law&quot; stipulates: &quot;It is prohibited to sexually harass women against their will through words, texts, images, physical behaviors, etc.&quot; If Lao Guo&#39;s behavior is determined to be sexual harassment, he may face Administrative penalties or civil compensation. According to Article 3 of the Supreme Court&#39;s &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Cases of Crimes of Obstructing Marriage and Family&quot;, it is also clearly stipulated that acts that infringe on the physical dignity of others that occur at other people&#39;s weddings may constitute crimes of impeding marriage and family. In short, the customary behavior of &quot;carrying the daughter-in-law into the house&quot; is very inappropriate and disrespectful of the bride&#39;s dignity. What do you think about this?

1850,"I disagree that male screenwriters are not good at writing film and television works about women or feminist themes. This has nothing to do with gender, but a matter of ability, values and aesthetics. In 1991, Sakamoto Yuji was able to write a character like Rika who dares to love and hate, and who challenges secular love relationships. The 10-year-old &quot;Mother&quot; focused on the issues of domestic violence and single mothers, and the 2012-year-old &quot;Problem Restaurant&quot; even discussed the workplace. Regarding the issue of sexual harassment, our country also had &quot;Don&#39;t Talk to Strangers&quot; as early as 2001, and in 2003 there were anti-domestic violence and sexual harassment TV series such as &quot;Women Are No Longer Silent.&quot; It was written in last year&#39;s hit &quot;Restart Life&quot; The screenwriter of this excellent female group drama &quot;Restart Life&quot; is also a male screenwriter. Looking at the female characters in films such as &quot;Green Snake&quot; and &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot; produced by Chinese director Tsui Hark more than 20 years ago, the female characters have already relied on gender stereotypes. The female characters in my favorite domestic drama &quot;The Way of Heaven&quot; are also mine. The goal of learning and striving. I think that the portrayal of female characters in this drama is the ceiling of domestic dramas and even Asian film and television dramas of the same period. I strongly recommend that current screenwriters and directors learn how to portray female characters. If you want to write about an idealist with faith, look at Rui Xiaodan. If you want to write about a resolute entrepreneur, look at Ouyang Xue. If you want to write about an independent and sober urban beauty, look at Xiao Yawen. The value and beauty of these women are all They do not rely on any male characters to set off their growth and transformation, and they do not depend on men.

The peak period of synaptic growth in children is also the period of fastest intellectual development. Sports, games, playing, fiddling, and graffiti are the main things children learn. form. What kind of care can make infants and young children feel full of security and deep love? What kind of companionship can help children learn to trust, stabilize their hearts, and steadily develop their life potential in a healthy attachment relationship? When children enter their sensitive period, what kind of support can help them maintain their innocent curiosity about the outside world and dare to launch dynamic explorations?

These are nothing more than face-saving relationships with macho ideas and treating women as resources.

The plot of this drama was good in the early stage, and everyone opened their mouths, but later they separated due to trust issues. The heroine is really good. She is very skilled. It is rare to see a heroine in a TV series who is a computer expert. She also knows how to protect herself in the workplace and will never let herself be wronged. She can also handle problems. The only thing that can make her bow her head is her son Quanquan. By letting him come into this world, she has taken good care of him. Quanquan is quite sensible and cute. There is also sexual harassment in the workplace, and girls should learn to use the law to protect themselves. Overall, this drama is okay. There are some clichés but I can watch it.

1894,"After watching more than ten episodes of &quot;Fearless&quot;, I have some interesting points and negative points. Let me talk about the negative points first: 1. Every time Luo Yingzi goes to the teacher for advice, she will call the female teacher &quot;Mr. Mei&quot;, which is really disgusting. 2. The flat images of classic bad women have caused the heroine’s suffering. For example, the image of an evil mother-in-law + a shrewd and calculating mistress + an ungrateful, uneducated and unskilled young woman who wants to use the heroine as a bridge. It’s all about women’s entrapment and attacks on women, not to mention that her cowardly and opinionated husband is the source of the heroine’s suffering. 3. After Yingzi was framed by her husband and saddled with a huge debt of nearly 20 million, she still put a soft light on her husband&#39;s existence and wanted to listen to his explanation (the man cheated, transferred his property, took out a lot of money, took out a lot of money, took out his mistress, and bought it in the United States) 800,000-dollar house and having children with his mistress) Cool points: 1. Strong workplace ability. As a newcomer in the workplace, he was crazy about his immediate boss, and did not let his stingy boss squeeze him and exploit him. He maintained a good relationship with the parties involved in the case, and acted together to threaten his boss, so as to get the salary. Transferred professional qualifications 2. Protected female colleague Qiu Hua and stood up for her when she faced rumors in the workplace 3. Qiu Hua helped Luo Yingzi investigate the case when her family was in debt, female mutual help is reflected here 4. Yingzi responded to the loan with tact My brother&#39;s sexual innuendo and sexual harassment, after being forced into a few words, achieved the effect of clear rejection + counter-threat + step down. I protected myself and preserved my connections without ruining them.

1943,"[, Scholar:] After many women accused Shi Hang of being suspected of sexual harassment online, and Shi Hang responded twice, the social impact of this incident continued. After Motie Books and &quot;New Weekly&quot; terminated their cooperative relationship with Shi Hang, the One-way Street Library issued a statement on Weibo on May 4: &quot;We have noticed the news about Shi Hang&#39;s sexual harassment incident. More than two dozen people broke the news. There are victims among us. We once again declare that One Direction will not cooperate with Shi Hang in any form.&quot; On the same day, Gulou West Theater also issued a statement: &quot;We remain highly concerned about Shi Hang&#39;s alleged sexual harassment accusations.

Gulou West Theater firmly supports and safeguards women&#39;s rights and has zero tolerance for all forms of offense and infringement.&quot; According to Qizhacha, Shi Hang He is one of the shareholders of Beijing Gulou West Culture Co., Ltd., with a shareholding ratio of 5.0332%. In addition, QY, who once accused Shi Hang of verbally and physically sexually harassing her in the workplace, told The Paper that she is starting to notarize the evidence. In response to this incident, The Paper reporter interviewed Feng Yuan, a researcher in the field of gender equality. In the discussion about this incident, many people interpreted the chat history between Shi Hang and the victim as &quot;flirting&quot; and believed that this was not sexual harassment. In this regard, Feng Yuan pointed out that the key to whether an act constitutes sexual harassment lies in the recipient of the act. If the recipient feels it is unwelcome, it is sexual harassment. And third parties are not qualified to judge. &quot;Sometimes the same sentence is very offensive or harassing to some people, but to others it may be what they expect, so the third party&#39;s standards cannot be used to measure the feelings of the parties involved.&quot; Feng Yuan explain. She also added that even if Shi Hang&#39;s ex-girlfriend is among the victims, harassment or assault may still occur in an intimate relationship.

It’s right for women to focus on their careers, but she has taken too many orders that make her feel uncomfortable. In this In the process, she did not realize the depletion these things had on her inner sense of worth. She is very able to endure hardships, and conceptually she seems to think this is what she should be doing. As time passed, I became numb. Then when she met a boy who showed superficial loyalty to her, she gave the boy the heartache that she deserved - &quot;Be good, don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; These words she actually wanted to say to the boy who was frightened in the rough environment. of myself. If you work among the private sector, you will frequently encounter sexual harassment and even physical harm, direct expressions of hostility and ridicule, it is difficult to hear very straightforward dirty words, and employers who default on debts and will not pay back money without resorting to thunderous means. Of course, the upper class will also encounter it, but after three years of operation, the frequency of being impacted is not that high. Relatively weak people will be crushed by this kind of grinding. If someone like Liu Xiaoqing is more down-to-earth and energetic, he might be able to squeeze a new career out of this. Lin Daiyu uproots the weeping willow trees and will only make herself sick from exhaustion. That little boyfriend is a typical male child in a Chinese family. He does not hesitate to express rigid loyalty to his parents (Huabing: I will be successful, I will be filial to you, just wait and enjoy the blessings...), and he has received a lot for it.

When the cost of justice is too high and her interests are harmed, she will not hesitate to abandon the heroines and beat them to give up their unrealistic fantasies.

The only time she takes action is Help made an exception because he framed the heroine due to his mistake, because he really respects and believes in the heroine&#39;s ability, and also appreciates the moral justice in the heroine that he does not have.

Every time he duels with the heroine, he is like a mentor and a sparring partner. He teaches the heroine how to grow by showing her how to grow without being arrogant. The stronger the heroine is, the more satisfied he is. Coupled with the buff of a bad guy who has no bottom line and just wants to make money, the heroine&#39;s character is really sweet and smelly. Her optimistic spirit of lying down and sleeping when the sky falls is really powerful. Her family conditions make her have no choice. Pursuing absolute justice without any burden is both enviable and irritating. What makes her angry is that she sometimes cannot understand the burdens of others. It seems that revenge is inevitable. In fact, she is in love with a brainless virgin. She still has illusions about her scumbag ex-husband until the last episode. I am Fang Lv and I want to scold her for being stupid. Is it because she is losing the lawsuit in disgrace? The heroine, Madonna, who has high emotional intelligence and strong abilities, can&#39;t stand it at all. After all, she is still a cool heroine overall. The characters of Boss Zhou and Tao Lu are also very likable.

1999,"Why do I feel so jealous, so sad, and in such a bad mood every time my sister mentions her kids? Why do I feel so sad every time when I think about my children that I burst into tears even though I am very happy? Try to reflect on yourself as much as possible and sort it out. 1. There is legitimacy in yourself. This is self-loathing. Every time I mentioned children, I would deeply feel the irrationality of my existence. Every time, it was a beating that made me suffer from strong inferiority and self-loathing. It makes me feel like my sister is just playing with me, this relationship is just child&#39;s play, and I am just a mistress being entertained. My sister has a family, but I am just a mistress who should disappear. I don&#39;t want to face this thing, always, don&#39;t want to face it. As sweet as it is when my sister and I get along, it hurts. It&#39;s all fake, it&#39;s all fake. 2. Childhood comparison. This is jealousy. I have never had such education and companionship since I was a child. Scientific education, loving and supporting everything my children like. When I was a child, I only had a missing father, a busy mother, and a brother who beat me violently. All kinds of beatings and scoldings, forcing me to stand, slapping, verbal abuse, and discrimination. My mother would be suspicious of me, call me a bitch, and my brother would beat me. I am a damn Peng family member, and the Peng family members are all dead people. I would be called sexually harassing names by my classmates, and I would live with low self-esteem. No one would stand by my side. No one has ever supported me so much. I have been like this all the way, and I have encouraged myself to get through it. I am a person who should have died a long time ago. I have never seen such an orthodox education. It turns out that being loved and brought up is like this. I am so envious, so envious, so envious. I have never had such an experience in my life. Family education is still the same today. It is always denial and abuse. So envious, so jealous. 3. Age gap. This is envy. Children will definitely be outstanding in the future. They will grow up in the light and be loved and nurtured. He won&#39;t become an adult like me. She still has unlimited possibilities, but I, at 23 years old, have long since aged. This is a natural jealousy of young people. The same sentiment as my sister. 4. Dislike of children This is hatred. I hate children, quite a bit. But these are the people my sister loves most and are the natural family members. He is someone I can never compare to. However, the other party is a child. This kind of relationship will only make me hate children even more. I will never have children in my life. Women don’t want it, and men don’t want it either. 5. Denial of oneself This is also unwillingness, another level of self-loathing. My sister once used me as an educational model to educate children. I am a negative teaching material. Am I a negative example? I can neither deny nor agree with it. It is true that I am not as good as children, but why should I be used as a negative teaching material to educate others? I love myself so much. Now, if you are willing to be in this kind of relationship, why should you be humiliated by your children? Only I can deny myself, and why do I have to accept this? 6. Possessiveness This is the possessiveness of love. I hope that my sister is mine alone, but this is impossible, it is unreasonable in itself, and I have long accepted this. But there is a gap between accepting reality and fully accepting it psychologically, isn&#39;t it? Every time I see children, I feel like I can only pick up the leftovers that my sister loves. It&#39;s really annoying. I put you first, but you are not, cannot be, and should not be. And everything, mixed together, turned into tears, shattering all my defenses. That&#39;s why every time I hear about children, I feel so bad. This is the dismantling of complex emotions. Only.

2001,"There are many Dionysus-level figures in this small mountainous county, and there is a legend that women from this county, as long as they can drink, are masters. It’s not surprising, it’s just a legend. Then when I got to the workplace, my female colleagues either didn&#39;t drink or were drunkards. For a while, I wondered, even though my drinking capacity is poor, any woman who dares to drink with you is a great drinker. But you don’t just surrender when you meet a random woman. Then, I discovered that it was a protective color. From then on, I stopped showing off to all the women I met who drank. I can get drunk, and you can do whatever you want. Because even in modern society, women still have to bear more burdens than me at the wine table. Going back to the past years, I still feel that men can drink as much as they want, but a woman has to give up a lot through drinking, perhaps more than everything a man values. Therefore, I have never seen an alcoholic woman in my life, and alcoholic men are gone.

Given the feudal legacy and average cognition of the current society, everyone should have some idea of the probability that this kind of incident could become a typical example. “In order to shape and save women. Is the design of this bridge segment really necessary? Is it because we don’t want to see Teacher Zhang saving women? To be honest, Teacher Zhang sympathizes with the wife whose husband is an alcoholic, and persuades the daughter at home to insist on going to school to avoid this cycle of marital tragedy. Wouldn&#39;t this plot be more powerful? The screenwriter of &quot;I am a Mountain&quot; worked hard to shape it, leaving out the real prototypes and breaking gender &quot;stereotypes&quot;. In fact, the six princesses who made great contributions came to seek justice. The statement defending the film on the grounds that &quot;the film has very little emphasis on male characters&quot; is also quite confusing. The skew in length of works with female characters is undeniable, but this does not mean that female characters must bear all the responsibilities for some social dross. It seems that the movie focuses closely on women, but in fact it blurs or even reverses reality in every corner. To be honest, the starting point of this movie is to praise Teacher Zhang. It neither attempts to discuss the reasons for the plight of rural women nor explore the obstacles that make it difficult for rural girls to go to school. The audience can understand and accept it, but it does not mean that everyone does not know the reasons behind this. historical legacy and traditional factors.

The police subsequently found multiple secretly photographed photos on her mobile phone and are currently investigating further. According to reports, the man involved is now 31 years old and is a staff member of the Cabinet Office of the Japanese Central Government. On that day, he tried to secretly photograph a female high school student in the elevator of the station. Station staff noticed that she was behaving abnormally, and immediately controlled her and handed her over to the police. When questioned by the police, the man confessed to the secret filming and said that the reason for the secret filming was &quot;because of excessive work pressure.&quot; The police later found a number of candid photos on the man&#39;s mobile phone and decided to conduct further investigation into the man. The Japanese Cabinet Office responded that it was &quot;currently under investigation and will not provide detailed explanations for the time being.&quot; This is not the first time that Japanese Cabinet Office personnel have been exposed to similar scandals. In September, Fumio Kishida had just significantly reorganized the cabinet and adjusted senior personnel of the Liberal Democratic Party. But just over a month later, cabinet members had troubles one after another. On October 26, Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party Senator Taro Yamada, the Administrative Officer of Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, was forced to resign from his post as Administrative Officer after an extramarital affair scandal was exposed. Fumio Kishida admitted in Congress that there was “appointment responsibility.” On October 31, Japan’s Deputy Minister of Justice Kakizawa Mitaru resigned due to alleged violations of the Public Office Election Law. Kakizawa is a member of parliament elected from Tokyo&#39;s Koto Ward. Previously, Koto Ward Mayor Kimura Yayoi and her team were raided by the Tokyo Prefectural Prosecutor&#39;s Special Investigation Department on suspicion of violating public office election laws. Kakizawa admitted that he made suggestions to Kimura regarding illegal campaigning. On November 13, Japanese Deputy Finance Minister Kenji Kanda was forced to resign due to the tax arrears scandal. Kanda is a tax accountant, but not only does his company owe taxes, he also violates industry regulations and fails to participate in necessary training. After the incident came to light, Kanda refused to resign for a time, but due to pressure, he had no choice but to resign on the 13th. Fumio Kishida apologized again in Congress for this. On November 17, Defense Ministry Administrative Officer Shingo Miyake was exposed by the media for sexually harassing a female subordinate. Defense Minister Minoru Kihara asked Miyake to explain the situation. According to the poll results released by Japan&#39;s &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; on the 19th, the approval rate of the cabinet led by Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio dropped to 21%, setting a new low since Kishida became prime minister in October 2021. Japanese media analyzed that the main reasons for the continued decline in Kishida&#39;s cabinet support rate were people&#39;s lack of support for the cabinet&#39;s new economic policies and the resignation of several cabinet members due to scandals. In this regard, 56% of the respondents believed that Kishida &quot;bears a great responsibility&quot;, and 55% of the respondents expressed the hope that Kishida would resign as soon as possible.

2040,"[Submission] Xiaohuapai Jiao chapter repo, Black Mud, involving spoilers of Jiao line, Ji line and Tang Hong line. The content is 500 words long. 12345678910 I read the demining matters carefully before buying it. I know everything about female competition, male superiority and female inferiority, virginity complex, etc. , so this repo does not cover these. All I can say is that they are all true, and they are quite lengthy. The current progress is that all Jiao and Ji lines have been passed, and Tang Hong has passed half of them. Official repo: 1.CG collapse. The most unacceptable point. I played the demo in advance and decided to buy it because the OP, vertical painting and the first CG were very beautiful. After actually playing it, I found that this was the beauty. As the main game of Jiaoxian, there is a lot of CG, but almost all of it is broken. The male protagonist’s face is broken, the female protagonist is bald, and the picture is rough. The CG quality of Ji Xian and Tang Hongxian is better, but the exquisiteness cannot be compared with the vertical painting OP, and the quantity is also smaller. 2. The content of Xiongjing differs from expectations. I thought it was because the male protagonists were constantly vying for the female protagonist&#39;s favor with their peacock feathers. They were fighting openly and secretly with each other&#39;s tea skills and martial arts. The female protagonist was swaying from side to side and made mistakes that all women in the world would make. The reality is that the male protagonists are in love and competing for the female protagonist&#39;s body, and the female protagonist is like a floating duck in the wind. Both her inner and outer body are hurt. Hime Line has some tea art teasing scenes, but they are very short. 3. Sexual harassment has reached the level of sexual assault. As mentioned above, I read the demining before buying it and was mentally prepared for sexual harassment, but the severity was higher than expected. Things that the male protagonist did to the female protagonist include forced tongue kissing, licking, stripping off clothes, rubbing breasts, (in public) touching the lower body with hands and borderline sexual intercourse, and (for those who did not reach the last step) raping. The heroine was not at all happy, and she resisted being scared throughout the whole process. Any heroine who is a little happy can be regarded as a side interest, but unfortunately there is no such thing. The Jiao line has mutually consensual edges and is not included. There may be players who are good at this, but not me. 4. The length is really short.

2086,"&quot;The Bird in the Cage&quot; is serialized @十年阳里i Mixed Gentle Attack ✘ Beauty is depressed and suffers 2. Mingzhou has insomnia. He lay on the bed, his fingers resting on the pull tab of the drawer. The empty wooden cabinet made Mingzhou collapse. All the sleeping pills hidden in the bedside table were taken away by the maid. The doctor repeatedly warned Mingzhou not to be so dependent on medicine. It was very difficult to hide medicine. Everyone knows that Mingzhou cannot be allowed to commit suicide. The young master is unwilling and unable to be admitted to a mental hospital and chooses to hide here, so he must take all measures to prevent the other party from committing suicide. Mingzhou Bai had hidden the medicine for so long. Just thinking about racking his brains and being careful some time ago was in vain. He was powerless. The air conditioner is turned on for heating, and the outdoor unit is a bit loud due to aging. The butterfly slept with its belly spread out in the nest. Mingzhou&#39;s upper body was naked, his hair was like algae, half of it was spread on his back and half of it was spread on the bed. Why is it so uncomfortable? why me? Why will I never get better? I don&#39;t want to live anymore. Mingzhou cried, his eyelids turning red. ...When morning came, Mingzhou was still weak. He was covered in cold sweat. The bed was like a bottomless sponge. Mingzhou was stuck in it and couldn&#39;t get out. Butterfly wanted to go to the toilet, so she screamed, licked Mingzhou&#39;s face, and asked someone to get up and open the door. &quot;Butterfly...&quot; He felt like vomiting as he spoke. Looking at the big dog&#39;s anxious expression, he struggled to sit up and open the door. The waitress was already waiting at the door. The expression on her face was very serious, she pursed her lips, frowned slightly, and glanced at Mingzhou. Logically speaking, if a waitress treats Mingzhou like this, she should leave. But now she is very popular with Ming Chongli, and she is simply arrogant in doing things. The butterfly rubbed Mingzhou&#39;s calf and fled out, its claws hitting the ground with a &quot;kick-kick-kick&quot; sound. &quot;Prepare breakfast for me.&quot; He spoke weakly, with no blood on his face, and the dark circles under his eyes made him look particularly tired. Even so, Mingzhou is eye-catchingly beautiful. The most beautiful house bird of the Ming Dynasty. The person Ming Chongli said didn&#39;t come until evening. Also following the guests was Mingcheng. Mingzhou&#39;s brother. Mingzhou, the two men who came down, didn&#39;t want to pay attention to them. He looked at the little girl getting off the passenger seat and finally felt a little happier. &quot;Button,&quot; he waved to the little girl, motioning for her to come over, &quot;Are you here to accompany me?&quot; Button is the son of the Ming family and has been with Mingzhou since he was a child. In fact, she is four years older than Mingzhou, but she has a baby face and looks smaller. Her pupils are large and black, and her facial features are delicate and beautiful, just like the ceramic dolls displayed in the window. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Button smiled at Mingzhou, &quot;The master said I can come over to accompany you. Xiuxiu will also come in a few days. Now all the servants here will be transferred to the old house, leaving only the two of us. Take care of you.&quot; Mingzhou cried again, feeling aggrieved and happy at the same time. It&#39;s not that Mingzhou likes to cry. He is sick, mentally sensitive and fragile, and always on the verge of emotional collapse. In addition, he is born with incontinence of tears, and his eyes can&#39;t wait to cry until he is blind. Mingcheng was accustomed to Mingzhou crying, so he casually looked at the shabby yard with no interest, and took a few casual glances at his cell phone before locking the phone and talking to Mingzhou again. &quot;Mingzhou, are you stupid for crying here?&quot; Mingcheng always speaks with a condescending tone. Many people feel uncomfortable hearing such a tone, but Mingzhou is used to it. His attitude towards Mingcheng Just like Mingcheng&#39;s attitude towards him, the two of them looked at each other with disgust. Mingzhou ignored this sentence and just let the button spin around in front of him, and then asked himself questions. The guests were quiet and did not engage in any conversation. He is very tall and has three-dimensional facial features, unlike those of Asians. This person is indeed not Asian, at least not entirely. His eyes are gray. Mingcheng was not annoyed by Mingzhou&#39;s attitude towards him. He turned around and said a few words to the guest before leading them in. Mingzhou looked back at the two people who had passed him. He was not unhappy, but felt numb in his heart. Butterfly was still in the yard, and the beautiful big dog barked twice when he saw the stranger. He looked at Mingcheng and felt that he looked familiar. He came closer and smelled it, and then started barking again. Mingcheng, a person that no dog likes. &quot;Butterfly, you are so snobbish. I fed you when you were a child, and it wasn&#39;t you who grabbed my legs for food? Now you actually scream at me, you are not a good girl anymore.&quot; Mingcheng raised his eyebrows and held his hand. On the waist, &quot;Sit down, stop barking.&quot; Butterfly listened to the instructions, swayed its butt without a tail twice, then sat on the ground, looking up at Mingcheng. &quot;Butterfly, go back.&quot; Mingzhou was only wearing a light gray sweater. He glanced at Mingcheng and didn&#39;t like the instructions he gave to his dog. Butterfly listened to Mingzhou&#39;s words even more. It looked at Mingzhou for a few times and then entered the house obediently. Mingzhou didn&#39;t want to go against Ming Chongli, but he still chose to turn a blind eye to his guests for the time being. But after seeing a few more people, Mingzhou already lost his strength. He did whatever Mingcheng wanted to do, waved his hand and entered the room. From the beginning to the end, Mingzhou never looked at the guest once and completely ignored Ming Chongli&#39;s instructions. ...The waitress didn&#39;t know that Mingcheng was here. She had forgotten her habits after staying here in Mingzhou. When she came down from the second floor and saw Mingcheng, her heart skipped a beat. &quot;You are too unruly.&quot; Mingcheng smiled, holding an empty cup in his hand. Button heated up the hot tea, poured the tea skillfully and placed it on the table in front of the two of them. &quot;My dad gave you a good look, but why do you have the guts to do this?&quot; Mingcheng raised his eyelids and continued talking without any smile in his eyes. &quot;Young Master...I, I, I&#39;m getting ready to greet you...&quot; The waitress spoke softly, not as unruly as she was in front of Mingzhou. &quot;The Ming family doesn&#39;t hate Mingzhou, do you understand? Why don&#39;t you think about it?&quot; Mingcheng turned his head to look at the buttons, took the person&#39;s hand, and pinched the other person&#39;s wrist. Button furrowed his eyebrows as he watched Mingcheng sexually harassing him. He used his skill to break free and left without looking back. &quot;Tsk,&quot; Mingcheng was not happy that the button left like this, and finally casually said to the waitress, &quot;You and I will go back to the old house in a while.&quot; Ming Chongli&#39;s man Ming Chongli cleaned up by himself, and he didn&#39;t have time to waste on this kind of thing. On unimportant people. Ming Chongli valued Mingzhou&#39;s value. If he knew that his precious little son was treated like this by a maid who was not even his mistress, some maids would be in trouble. &quot;Mingzhou doesn&#39;t seem to welcome me.&quot; Husband Wanyuan looked around the room with interest. He was only wearing a shirt on such a cold day. After entering the air-conditioned house, he still felt a little hot. He untied it with one hand. Two buttons. &quot;He doesn&#39;t welcome anyone,&quot; Mingcheng shrugged, &quot;especially you and me.&quot; There were daffodils in the living room, and the leaves were hanging weakly because of the air conditioning. &quot;He doesn&#39;t like men?&quot; Fu Wanyuan suddenly asked with a serious expression. Mingcheng was in a daze and couldn&#39;t understand her husband Wan Yuan&#39;s brain circuit. &quot;Him? How do I know if he likes men? He can only like people arranged by Ming Chongli.&quot; He can only like people arranged by Ming Chongli. What a statement. Husband Wanyuan&#39;s mother is Russian. He has lived in Europe since he was a child, and occasionally spends a year in China. His way of thinking is &quot;straightforward&quot; that is common among Europeans and Americans, and few people talk to him in a roundabout way. Not really understanding Mingcheng&#39;s answer to him, he could only temporarily attribute the reason to the fact that Ming Jia&#39;s elders may have different ideas than ordinary people. The guest room was neatly tidied up with the click of a button. Along with them were other servants of the Ming family. These people were all the people Mingcheng was accustomed to, so she placed things and dealt with things very quickly. It was almost half past eight when the meal was ready.

2088,"【】The &quot;China Statistical Yearbook 2023&quot; compiled and published by the National Bureau of Statistics published the birth rate, death rate and natural growth rate data of 31 provinces. A reporter from China Business News found that in 2022, the birth rate of 9 provinces will exceed 8 per thousand (8‰); in 20 provinces, the natural population growth rate (natural increase in population (number of births - number of deaths)/average total population in the same period) population) was negative, an increase of 7 from the previous year. Generally speaking, the current measures to encourage childbirth in various places include the payment of maternity subsidies, house purchase subsidies and other measures, and the target targets are mainly families with two or three children. But encouraging childbearing cannot just focus on the second and third children. Dong Yuzheng, a population expert and special researcher at the Counselor&#39;s Office of the Guangdong Provincial Government, believes that there are now more measures to encourage the birth of three children in various places, and some are also encouraging the birth of two children, while relatively speaking, there are fewer one-child births. However, the number of three-child births is inherently small. To significantly improve the actual effect of the active family planning policy, the focus of childbirth subsidies must be moved forward and the fundamentals of one-child births must be consolidated. &quot;Encouraging childbearing should start with one child.&quot; The birth rate of O31 provinces: 9 provinces exceed 8‰, and the natural population growth rate of 20 provinces is negative.",119,0.06095726199295928,2,0,131,4,4,0,0,1,1,0,99.9999,"[0.9926072419674105, 0.9748766408114948, 0.13386046261622042, 0.201734437441077, 0.3814757611108166, 0.8259995630286064, 0.9781318264053166, 0.0181452242932979, 0.9695876105562129, 0.8492329243570576, 0.20088977345980963, 0.941691477309026, 0.5240851034071005, 0.5591907345142934, 0.19492536954542738, 0.8490293776796024, 0.3593419651221308, 0.5765142757536506, 0.9596129110884596, 0.4876463579744915, 0.22557380595539933]"

In 2020, during a Christmas lunch at Prenafita&#39;s home, he kissed two 18-year-old team members without consent. The two players, who had trained with him since they were 14 years old and regarded him as their father, described him as &quot;meaningful&quot;. Unexpected, surprising and unpleasant (behaviour)”. Prenafita, 51, was also found to have created a sexually suggestive atmosphere by playing games involving sexual issues and drinking alcohol. In addition to his two-year sentence, Prenafita was also banned from entering within 200 meters of the two victims for three years and ordered to pay €3,000 each for psychological harm.

Big S sued Ge for infringement of reputation, but Ge Siqi lost the lawsuit. Since justice is sought through judicial channels, it stands to reason that Huang Zijiao should be prosecuted.

2105,"I finished it (the second domestic drama I followed this year), and I really enjoyed it. Although the part about the sexual harassment case was lengthy, it was very meaningful (it was a bit long and the plot was a bit draggy). The idea was very good, and it clearly pointed out similar cases of sexual harassment in the workplace. The difficulty of situations such as domestic violence and domestic violence has been mentioned and analyzed in depth, which is its value and significance); the characters are very vivid, everyone has their own characteristics and personality, and the actors are very Different characters are portrayed, and they are real characters (rather than flat images). Some people love them to the point of love, and some people hate them to the bone. However, there are some shortcomings, and they are somewhat unrealistic, but after all, film and television works come from life but can be more exaggerated (and in many cases in real life, they may be more &quot;exciting&quot; than TV series). Regarding Luo Yingzi&#39;s slap at the airport, it was a heart-wrenching slap. What&#39;s even better is that all the emotions in the previous few minutes were foreshadowed. It was the grievances, tolerance, love and hate of the entire drama that finally broke out in this slap. But I still have to say that even if she is a saint, even if Luo Yingzi&#39;s father taught her from a young age that she should repay evil with kindness, be considerate of the difficulties of others, and feel the suffering and pity of the world, after everything she has experienced, he will not consider explaining the past. My pillow partner is this bastard ex-husband (although I’m not divorced, I feel bad about my husband). Love is very important, but you should give sympathy and empathy to those who deserve it. For the sake of the scumbag and his family, even if you take a step back, for the sake of yourself who once loved the scumbag. There is no need to have any sympathy for him, no need to hope that his sentence will be reduced by a few years, and no need to find ways to reduce his sentence, because [it] really does not deserve it.
